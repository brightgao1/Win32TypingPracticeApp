"The Council, the Council can go to hell. And the emergency session can go to hell. And you, you can go to hell too. I wouldn't want you to feel left out!"

"Always this busy around here?" "Yes. We like it that way."

Trust The Computer. The Computer is your friend.
The disadvantage of working over networks is that you can't so easily go into someone else's office and rip their bloody heart out
Never trust a computer you can't throw out a window.
Part of the inhumanity of the computer is that, once it is competently programmed and working smoothly, it is completely honest.
I do not fear computers. I fear lack of them.
Software is the soul to the lifeless body of the hardware.
Any significant boost in technology could just as easily be a rigged demo.
Humans are the best value in computers - where else can you get a non-linear computer weighing only about 160lbs, having a billion binary decision elements, that can be mass-produced by unskilled labour?
Heuristics are bug ridden by definition - if they didn't have bugs, then they'd be algorithms.
You have a hardware or a software problem
NEVER EVER mess with a PCB jumper you don't understand, even if it's labelled 'SEX AND FREE BEER'.
Software suppliers are trying to make their software packages more user-friendly... Their best approach, so far, has been to take all the old brochures, and stamp the words, 'user-friendly' on the cover

Captain Elizabeth Lochley : What the hell is your problem? Michael Garibaldi : For starters, I don't know you, therefore I don't trust you. Captain Elizabeth Lochley : The world is full of people you don't know. Michael Garibaldi : I worry about that all the time.
Captain John Sheridan : Are you trying to cheer me up? Susan Ivanova : No sir, wouldn't dream of it. Captain John Sheridan : Good, I hate being cheered up. Susan Ivanova : In that case we're all going to die slow, agonizing deaths. Captain John Sheridan : Thank you, I feel so much better now.
Susan Ivanova : Always finding good in every situation, Captain? Captain John Sheridan : Absolutely. If I didn't, I might end up like you. Susan Ivanova : Hey, what's that supposed to mean? Did anybody else hear that?
Ambassador Londo Mollari : When I said my quarters were cold, I did not mean, 'Oh, I think it's a little chilly in here, perhaps I'll throw a blanket on the bed.' No, I said it was COLD, as in, 'Oh, my left arm has snapped off like an icicle and shattered on the floor'! This is highly inappropriate, Captain! Captain John Sheridan : You're right. There are several other parts of your body I'd much rather see snapped off.
Dukhat : When others do a foolish thing, you should tell them it is a foolish thing. They can still continue to do it, but at least the truth is where it needs to be.
Kosh Naranek : The avalanche has already started; it is too late for the pebbles to vote.
Susan Ivanova : Ivanova is always right. I will listen to Ivanova. I will not ignore Ivanova's recommendations. Ivanova is God. *And*, if this ever happens again, Ivanova will personally rip your lungs out!
Captain Susan Ivanova : Good luck, captain. I think you're about to go where... everyone has gone before.
Ambassador Vir Cotto : Prophecy is a guess that comes true. When it doesn't, it's a metaphor.
Lennier : They trained you well on Minbar. Marcus Cole : They said I had a lot of repressed anger. Lennier : And? Marcus Cole : I'm not repressed anymore!
Elric : As I look at you, Ambasador Mollari, I see a great hand reaching out of the stars. And I hear sounds; the sounds of billions of people calling out your name. Ambassador Londo Mollari : My followers? Elric : Your victims.
Citizen G'Kar : Do you want to be president? Captain John Sheridan : Yes. Citizen G'Kar : Then put your hand on the book and say I do. Captain John Sheridan : I do. Citizen G'Kar : Good, let's eat.
Sinclair : I'm still waiting for an explanation, gentlemen. Ambassador Londo Mollari : Yes, and I'm prepared to give you one, Commander, as soon as the room stops spinning. Sinclair : This station creates gravity by rotation. It never stops spinning. Ambassador Londo Mollari : Well, you begin to see my problem.
Ambassador Londo Mollari : Stop eating that! You don't even know what it is. Citizen G'Kar : Something called..."rice." Ambassador Londo Mollari : Yes. And if it was any good, do you think they would have been standing there, throwing it at people?
Major Krantz : What if we take you with us, put you on trial. Zathras : Zathras not of this time. You take, Zathras die. You leave, Zathras die. Either way, it is bad for Zathras.
Citizen G'Kar : If I take a lamp and shine it toward the wall, a bright spot will appear on the wall. The lamp is our search for truth... for understanding. Too often, we assume that the light on the wall is God, but the light is not the goal of the search, it is the result of the search. The more intense the search, the brighter the light on the wall. The brighter the light on the wall, the greater the sense of revelation upon seeing it. Similarly, someone who does not search - who does not bring a lantern - sees nothing. What we perceive as God is the by-product of our search for God. It may simply be an appreciation of the light... pure and unblemished... not understanding that it comes from us. Sometimes we stand in front of the light and assume that we are the center of the universe - God looks astonishingly like we do - or we turn to look at our shadow and assume that all is darkness. If we allow ourselves to get in the way, we defeat the purpose, which is to use the light of our search to illuminate the wall in all its beauty and in all its flaws; and in so doing, better understand the world around us.
Drazi Ambassador : Captain Sheridan! We thought you were dead! Captain John Sheridan : I was. I'm better now.
Marcus Cole : [after beating someone for information] Its like I always say, you get more with a kind word and a two-by-four than with just a kind word.
Susan Ivanova : Ambassador, do you really want to know what's going on down there? Ambassador Londo Mollari : Yes, absolutely! Susan Ivanova : Boom. Boom boom boom. Boom boom. Boom! Have a nice day!
Citizen G'Kar : With luck, they may never find you, but if they do, you will know pain... Na'Toth #2 : And you will know fear. Citizen G'Kar : And then you will die. Have a pleasant flight.
Lt. Kemmer: I demand you open a channel to Earth at once. Susan Ivanova : I'm a Lieutenant Commander on Earth Force, Major. I don't take demands. If you will request, I will consider it. Lt. Kemmer: Very well, then. I request that you open a channel to Earthdome. Susan Ivanova : Request denied. Have a nice day.
Sinclair : Ready? Delenn : Why is it that your people always ask someone if they are ready right before you are about to do something massively unwise? Sinclair : Tradition.
Captain John Sheridan : Delenn, I have been working up a good mad all day and I am NOT about to let you ruin it by agreeing with me!
Lt. Commander Susan Ivanova : I'll *gain* weight! Dr. Stephen Franklin : At first, yes. Lt. Commander Susan Ivanova : Fine! All my life I've fought against imperialism; now *I'm* the expanding Russian frontier! Dr. Stephen Franklin : Yes, but with very nice borders.

To attempt an understanding of Muad'Dib without understanding his mortal enemies, the Harkonnens, is to attempt seeing Truth without knowing Falsehood. It is the attempt to see the Light without knowing Darkness. It cannot be.
A beginning is the time for taking the most delicate care that the balances are correct. This every sister of the Bene Gesserit knows. To begin your study of the life of Muad'Dib, then, take care that you first place him in his time: born in the 57th year of the Padishah Emperor, Shaddam IV. And take the most special care that you locate Muad'Dib in his place: the planet Arrakis. Do not be deceived by the fact that he was born on Caladan and lived his first fifteen years there. Arrakis, the planet known as Dune, is forever his place.

If you think of yourselves as helpless and ineffectual, it is certain that you will create a despotic government to be your master. The wise despot, therefore, maintains among his subjects a popular sense that they are helpless and ineffectual.
"Why do you test for humans?" he asked. "To set you free." "Free?" "Once men turned their thinking over to machines in hope that this would set them free. But that only permitted other men with machines to enslave them." "Thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a man's mind," Paul quoted.

"No. We have to stay here and there's a simple reason why. Ask ten different scientists about the environment, population control, genetics and you'll get ten different answers, but there's one thing every scientist on the planet agrees on. Whether it happens in a hundred years or a thousand years or a million years, eventually our Sun will grow cold and go out. When that happens, it won't just take us.

There's no secret to balance. You just have to feel the waves.
When you think to take determination of your fate into your own hands, that is the moment you can be crushed. Be cautious. Allow for surprises. When we create, there are always other forces at work.
Intelligence takes chance with limited data in an arena where mistakes are not only possible but also necessary.
Seek freedom and become captive of your desires. Seek discipline and find your liberty.
We witness a passing phase of eternity. Important things happen but some people never notice. Accidents intervene. You are not present at episodes. You depend on reports. And people shutter their minds. What good are reports? History in a news account? Preselected at an editorial conference, digested and excreted by prejudice? Accounts you need seldom come from those who make history. Diaries, memoirs and autobiographies are subjective forms of special pleading. Archives are crammed with such suspect stuff.
Enter no conflict against fanatics unless you can defuse them. Oppose a religion with another religion only if your proofs (miracles) are irrefutable or if you can mesh in a way that the fanatics accept you as god-inspired.

The beginning of knowledge is the discovery of something we do not understand
I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.
A process cannot be understood by stopping it. Understanding must move with the flow of the process, must join it and flow with it.

"What do you despise? By this are you truly known."
"People need hard times and oppression to develop psychic muscles."
Thus spoke St. Alia-of-the-Knife: "The Reverend Mother must combine the seductive wiles of a courtesan with the untouchable majesty of a virgin goddess, holding these attributes in tension so long as the powers of her youth endure. For when youth and beauty have gone, she will find that the place-between, once occupied by tension, has become a wellspring of cunning and resourcefulness."
You have read that Muad'Dib had no playmates his own age on Caladan. The dangers were too great. But Muad'Dib did have wonderful companion-teachers. There was Gurney Halleck, the troubadour-warrior. You will sing some of Gurney's songs as you read along in this book. There was Thufir Hawat, the old Mentat Master of Assassins, who struck fear even into the heart of the Padishah Emperor. There were Duncan Idaho, the Swordmaster of the Ginaz; Dr. Wellington Yueh, a name black in treachery but bright in knowledge; the Lady Jessica, who guided her son in the Bene Gesserit Way, and--of course--the Duke Leto, whose qualities as a father have long been overlooked.
How do we approach the study of Muad'Dib's father? A man of surpassing warmth and surprising coldness was the Duke Leto Atreides. Yet, many facts open the way to this Duke: his abiding love for his Bene Gesserit lady; the dreams he held for his son; the devotion with which men served him. You see him there--a man snared by Destiny, a lonely figure with his light dimmed behind the glory of his son. Still, one must ask: What is the son but an extension of the father?
With the Lady Jessica and Arrakis, the Bene Gesserit system of sowing implant-legends through the Missionaria Protectiva came to its full fruition. The wisdom of seeding the known universe with a prophecy pattern for the protection of B.G. personnel has long been appreciated, but never have we seen a condition-utextremis with more ideal mating of person and preparation. The prophetic legends had taken on Arrakis even to the extent of adopted labels (including Reverend Mother, canto and respondu, and most of the Shari-a panoplia propheticus). And it is generally accepted now that the Lady Jessica's latent abilities were grossly underestimated.
"Yueh! Yueh! Yueh!" goes the refrain. "A million deaths were not enough for Yueh!"
Many have marked the speed with which Muad'Dib learned the necessities of Arrakis. The Bene Gesserit, of course, know the basis of this speed. For the others, we can say that Muad'Dib learned rapidly because his first training was in how to learn. And the first lesson of all was the basic trust that he could learn. It's shocking to find how many people do not believe they can learn, and how many more believe learning to be difficult. Muad'Dib knew that every experience carries its lesson.
What had the Lady Jessica to sustain her in her time of trial? Think you carefully on this Bene Gesserit proverb and perhaps you will see: "Any road followed precisely to its end leads precisely nowhere. Climb the mountain just a little to test that it's a mountain. From the top of the mountain, you cannot see the mountain."
It is said that the Duke Leto blinded himself to the perils of Arrakis, that he walked heedlessly into the pit. Would it not be more likely to suggest he had lived so long in the presence of extreme danger he misjudged a change in its intensity? Or is it possible he deliberately sacrificed himself that his son might find a better life? All evidence indicates the Duke was a man not easily hoodwinked.
Over the exit of the Arrakeen landing field, crudely carved as though with a poor instrument, there was an inscription that Muad'Dib was to repeat many times. He say it that first night on Arrakis, having been brought to the ducal command post to participate in his father's first full staff conference. The words of the inscription were a plea to those leaving Arrakis, but they fell with dark import on the eyes of a boy who had just escaped a close brush with death. They said: "O you who know what we suffer here, do not forget us in your prayers."
On that first day when Muad'Dib rode through the streets of Arrakeen with his family, some of the people along the way recalled the legends and the prophecy and they ventured to shout: "Mahdi!" But their shout was more a question than a statement, for as yet they could only hope he was the one foretold as the Lisan al-Gaib, the Voice from the Outer World. Their attention was focused, too, on the mother, because they had heard she was a Bene Gesserit and it was obvious to them that she was like the other Lisan al-Gaib.
"There is probably no more terrible instant of enlightenment than the one in which you discover your father is a man--with human flesh."
My father, the Padishah Emperor, took me by the hand one day and I sensed in the ways my mother had taught me that he was disturbed. He led me down the Hall of Portraits to the ego-likeness of the Duke Leto Atreides. I marked the strong resemblance between them--my father and this man in the portrait--both with thin, elegant faces and sharp features dominated by cold eyes. "Princess-daughter," my father said, "I would that you'd been older when it came time for this man to choose a woman." My father was 71 at the time and looking no older than the man in the portrait, and I was but 14, yet I remember deducing in that instant that my father secretly wished the Duke had been his son, and disliked the political necessities that made them enemies.
Greatness is a transitory experience. It is never consistent. It depends in part upon the myth-making imagination of humankind. The person who experiences greatness must have a feeling for the myth he is in. He must reflect what is projected upon him. And he must have a strong sense of the sardonic. This is what uncouples him from belief in his own pretensions. The sardonic is all that permits him to move within himself. Without this quality, even occasional greatness will destroy a man.
"There is no escape--we pay for the violence of our ancestors."
Do you wrestle with dreams? Do you contend with shadows? Do you move in a kind of sleep? Time has slipped away. Your life is stolen. You tarried with trifles, Victim of your folly.
There is a legend that the instant the Duke Leto Atreides died a meteor streaked across the skies above his ancestral palace on Caladan.
O Seas of Caladan, O people of Duke Leto-- Citadel of Leto fallen, Fallen forever...
When my father, the Padishah Emperor, heard of Duke Leto's death and the manner of it, he went into such a rage as we had never before seen. He blamed my mother and the compact forced on him to place a Bene Gesserit on the throne. He blamed the Guild and the evil old Baron. He blamed everyone in sight, not excepting even me, for he said I was a witch like all the others. And when I sought to comfort him, saying it was done according to an older law of self-preservation to which even the most ancient rulers gave allegiance, he sneered at me and asked if I thought him a weakling. I saw then that he had been aroused to this passion not by concern over the dead Duke but by what that death implied for all royalty. As I look back on it, I think there may have been some prescience in my father, too, for it is certain that his line and Muad'Dib's shared common ancestry.
Muad'Dib could indeed, see the Future, but you must understand the limits of this power. Think of sight. You have eyes, yet cannot see without light. If you are on the floor of a valley, you cannot see beyond your valley. Just so, Muad'Dib could not always choose to look across the mysterious terrain. He tells us that a single obscure decision of prophecy, perhaps the choice of one word over another, could change the entire aspect of the future. He tells us "The vision of time is broad, but when you pass through it, time becomes a narrow door." And always, he fought the temptation to choose a clear, safe course, warning "That path leads ever down into stagnation."
At the age of fifteen, he had already learned silence.
We came from Caladan--a paradise world for our form of life. There existed no need on Caladan to build a physical paradise or a paradise of the mind--we could see the actuality all around us. And the price we paid was the price men have always paid for achieving a paradise in this life.--we went soft, we lost our edge.
Family life of the Royal Creche is difficult for many people to understand, but I shall try to give you a capsule view of it. My father had only one real friend, I think. That was Count Hasimir Fenring, the genetic-eunuch and one of the deadliest fighters in the Imperium. The Count, a dapper and ugly little man, brought a new slave-concubine to my father one day and I was dispatched by my mother to spy on the proceedings. All of us spied on my father as a matter of self-protection. One of the slave-concubines permitted my father under the Bene Gesserit-Guild agreement could not, of course, bear a Royal Successor, but the intrigues were constant and oppressive in their similarity. We became adept, my mother and sisters and I, at avoiding subtle instruments of death. It may seem a dreadful thing to say, but I'm not at all sure my father was innocent in all these attempts. A Royal Family is not like other families. Here was a new slave-concubine, then, red-haired like my father, willowy and graceful. She had a dancer's muscles, and her training obviously had included neuro-enticement. My father looked at her for a long time as she postured unclothed before him. Finally he said: "She is too beautiful. We will save her as a gift." You have no idea how much consternation this restraint created in the Royal Creche. Subtlety and self-control were, after all, the most deadly threats to us all.
This Fremen religious adaptation, then, is the source of what we now recognize as "The Pillars of the Universe," whose Qizara Tafwid are among us all with signs and proofs and prophecy. They bring us the Arrakeen mystical fusion whose profound beauty is typified by the stirring music built on the old forms, but stamped with the new awakening. Who has not heard and been deeply moved by "The Old Man's Hymn"? I drove my feet through a desert Whose mirage fluttered like a host. Voracious for glory, greedy for danger, I roamed the horizons of al-Kulab, Watching time level mountains In its search and its hunger for me. And I saw the sparrows swiftly approach, Bolder than the onrushing wolf. They spread in the tree of my youth. I heard the flock in my branches. And was caught on their beaks and claws!
Prophecy and prescience--How can they be put to the test in the face of the unanswered questions? Consider: How much is actual prediction of the "wave form" (as Muad'Dib referred to his vision-image) and how much is the prophet shaping the future to fit the prophecy? What of the harmonics inherent in the act of prophecy? Does the prophet see the future or does he see a line of weakness, a fault or cleavage that he may shatter with words or decisions as a diamond-cutter shatters his gem with a blow of a knife?
The Fremen were supreme in that quality the ancients called "spannungsbogen"--which is the self-imposed delay between desire for a thing and the act of reaching out to grasp that thing.
My father, the Padishah Emperor, was 72 yet looked no more than 35 the year he encompassed the death of Duke Leto and gave Arrakis back to the Harkonnens. He seldom appeared in public wearing other than a Sardaukar uniform and a Burseg's black helmet with the Imperial lion in gold upon its crest. The uniform was an open reminder of where his power lay. He was not always that blatant, though. When he wanted, he could radiate charm and sincerity, but I often wonder in these later days if anything about him was as it seemed. I think now he was a man fighting constantly to escape the bars of an invisible cage. You must remember that he was an emperor, father-head of a dynasty that reached back into the dimmest history. But we denied him a legal son. Was this not the most terrible defeat a ruler ever suffered? My mother obeyed her Sister Superiors where the Lady Jessica disobeyed. Which of them was the stronger? History already has answered.
God created Arrakis to train the faithful.

"I can imagine no man who will look with more horror on the End than a conscientious revolution­ary who has, in a sense sincerely, been justifying cruelties and injustices inflicted on millions of his contemporaries by the benefits which he hopes to confer on future generations: generations who, as one terrible moment now reveals to him, were never going to exist. Then he will see the massacres, the faked trials, the deportations, to be all ineffaceably real, an essential part, his part, in the drama that has just ended: while the future Utopia had never been anything but a fantasy."
"Christian Apocalyptic offers us no such hope. It does not even foretell, (which would be more tolerable to our habits of thought) a gradual decay. It foretells a sudden, violent end imposed from without; an extinguisher popped onto the candle, a brick flung at the gramophone, a curtain rung down on the play—"Halt!"
"The doctrine of the Second Coming teaches us that we do not and cannot know when the world drama will end. The curtain may be rung down at any moment: say, before you have finished reading this paragraph."
"The doctrine of the Second Coming has failed, so far as we are concerned, if it does not make us realize that at every moment of every year in our lives Donne's question "What if this present were the world's last night?" is equally relevant."
"Frantic administration of panaceas to the world is certainly discouraged by the reflection that "this present" might be "the world's last night"; sober work for the future, within the limits of ordinary morality and prudence, is not."
"For what comes is Judgment: happy are those whom it finds laboring in their vocations, whether they were merely going out to feed the pigs or laying good plans to deliver humanity a hundred years hence from some great evil. The curtain has indeed now fallen. Those pigs will never in fact be fed, the great campaign against White Slavery or Governmental Tyranny will never in fact proceed to victory. No matter; you were at your post when the Inspection came."

If you want to lose weight, don't buy a new scale; change your diet. If you want to improve your software, don't test more; develop better.

If it keeps up, man will atrophy all his limbs but the push-button finger.
ining the workforce of tomorrow with today's high schools is like trying to teach kids about today's computers on a 50-year-old mainframe.
If software were as unreliable as economic theory, there wouldn't be a plane made of anything other than paper that could get off the ground.
Computers are like bikinis. They save people a lot of guesswork.
If the automobile had followed the same development cycle as the computer, a Rolls-Royce would today cost $100, get a million miles per gallon, and explode once a year, killing everyone inside.
All parts should go together without forcing. You must remember that the parts you are reassembling were disassembled by you. Therefore, if you can't get them together again, there must be a reason. By all means, do not use a hammer.
Technical people are better off not looking at patents. If somebody sues you, you change the algorithm or you just hire a hit-man to whack the stupid git.
Considering the current sad state of our computer programs, software development is clearly still a black art, and cannot yet be called an engineering discipline.
At this time I do not have a personal relationship with a computer.
For a long time it puzzled me how something so expensive, so leading edge, could be so useless, and then it occurred to me that a computer is a stupid machine with the ability to do incredibly smart things, while computer programmers are smart people with the ability to do incredibly stupid things. They are, in short, a perfect match.
The real problem is not whether machines think but whether men do.
Kirk: Do you want to know something? Everybody's human. Spock: I find that remark insulting.
There's an old story about the person who wished his computer were as easy to use as his telephone. That wish has come true, since I no longer know how to use my telephone.
I think and think for months and years. Ninety-nine times, the conclusion is false. The hundredth time I am right.
The first rule of any technology used in a business is that automation applied to an efficient operation will magnify the efficiency. The second is that automation applied to an inefficient operation will magnify the inefficiency.
See, no matter how clever your automation systems might be, it all falls apart if your human wetware isn't up to the job.
That's the thing about people who think they hate computers. What they really hate is lousy programmers.
On the Internet, nobody knows you're a dog.
Standards are always out of date. That's what makes them standards.
Scotty: She's all yours, sir. All systems automated and ready. A chimpanzee and two trainees could run her! Kirk: Thank you, Mr. Scott, I'll try not to take that personally.
I just found out that the brain is like a computer. If that's true, then there really aren't any stupid people. Just people running DOS.
People sould not fear their governments, governments should fear their people.
Before we can start, make sure you have the following: 1. Computer with installed Linux OS 2. Asterisk's installation packages 3. Some free time to spend ;o) 4. An IQ higher than the freezing point of water (in Celsius)
"Sometimes lies were more dependable than the truth."
"The power to cause pain is the only power that matters, the power to kill and destroy, because if you can't kill then you are always subject to those who can, and nothing and no one will ever save you."
"I've lived too long with pain. I won't know who I am without it."
"I think it's impossible to really understand somebody, what they want, what they believe, and not love them the way they love themselves."
[why he attacked a boy who was down] "Knocking him down won the first fight. I wanted to win all the next ones too."
All is going well, very well. I couldn't ask for anything better- So Why do I hate my life?
He had the respect of everyone, and he was treated with deference in his evening practices. Commanders came to study what he did. Other soldiers approached his table at mess and asked permission to sit down. Even the teachers were respectful. He had so much damn respect he wanted to scream.
"I need you to be clever Bean. I need you to think of solutions to problems we haven't seen yet. I want you to try things that no one has ever tried because they're absolutely stupid."
Ender knew at this moment he might be able to walk out of the room and end the battle. But the battle would only be fought again. Again and again until the will to fight was finished. The only way to end things completely was to hurt Bonzo enough that his fear was stronger than his hate.
"I keep thinking of things I don't want to remember. My whole life keeps playing out as if I were a recorder and someone else wanted to watch the most terrible parts of my life."
"We have to go. I'm almost happy here."
It was just him and me. He fought with honor. If it weren't for his honor, he and the others would have beaten me together. They might have killed me, then. His sense of honor saved my life. I didn't fight with honor... I fought to win.
Thank you for this... For dry eyes and silent weeping. You taught me how to hide anything I felt. More than ever, I need that now.
How far should one accept the rules of the society in which one lives? To put it another way: at what point does conformity become corruption? Only by answering such questions does the conscience truly define itself.
Think if you want to stay alive. Fear will kill you if you don't control it.
You read too much and understand too little.
Only the man who could look into the future without worry could thoroughly enjoy the present.
There's no patriotism, that's what it is. And no matriotism, either.
He was a self-made man who owed his lack of success to nobody.
iam a phd remember.. i dont have skills!
I must admit, kernel developers do a really good job to piss off people, we can't do better.
How should I know if it works? That's what beta testers are for. I only coded it
I'm an idiot.. At least this one [bug] took about 5 minutes to find...
If you want to travel around the world and be invited to speak at a lot of different places, just write a Unix operating system.
Really, I'm not out to destroy Microsoft. That will just be a completely unintentional side effect.
An infinite number of monkeys typing into GNU emacs would never make a good program.
Hey, maybe I could apply for a saint-hood from the Pope. Does somebody know what his email-address is? I'm so nice it makes you puke.
When you say "I wrote a program that crashed Windows", people just stare atyou blankly and say "Hey, I got those with the system, *for free*"
Other than the fact Linux has a cool name, could someone explain why I should use Linux over BSD? No. That's it. The cool name, that is. We worked very hard on creating a name that would appeal to the majority of people, and it certainly paid off: thousands of people are using linux just to be able to say "OS/2? Hah. I've got Linux. What a cool name". 386BSD made the mistake of putting a lot of numbers and weird abbreviations into the name, and is scaring away a lot of people just because it sounds too technical.
The day people think linux would be better served by somebody else (FSF being the natural alternative), I'll "abdicate". I don't think that it's something people have to worry about right now - I don't see it happening in the near future. I enjoy doing linux, even though it does mean some work, and I haven't gotten any complaints (some almost timid reminders about a patch I have forgotten or ignored, but nothing negative so far). Don't take the above to mean that I'll stop the day somebody complains: I'm thick-skinned (Lasu, who is reading this over my shoulder commented that "thick-HEADED is closer to the truth") enough to take some abuse. If I weren't, I'd have stopped developing linux the day ast ridiculed me on c.o.minix. What I mean is just that while linux has been my baby so far, I don't want to stand in the way if people want to make something better of it.
Intelligence is the ability to avoid doing work, yet getting the work done.
Narn: "What is truth and what is god?" G'Kar: "Truth is a river. (Narns gasp)" Narn: "And what is god?" G'Kar: "God is the mouth of the river."
"I'm going to f---ing bury that guy, I have done it before, and I will do it again. I'm going to f---ing kill Google.
Linux is a cancer that attaches itself in an intellectual property sense to everything it touches.
My children - in many dimensions they're as poorly behaved as many other children, but at least on this dimension I've got my kids brainwashed: You don't use Google, and you don't use an iPod.
We've had DRM in Windows for years. The most common format of music on an iPod is "stolen".
I have never, honestly, thrown a chair in my life.
Google's not a real company. It's a house of cards.
There's no chance that the iPhone is going to get any significant market share. No chance.
We don't have a monopoly. We have market share. There's a difference.
DRM is the future.
Reality is an illusion that occurs due to the lack of alcohol.
You're not drunk if you can lie on the floor without holding on.
An alcoholic is someone you don't like who drinks as much as you do.
Beer is not a good cocktail-party drink, especially in a home where you don't know where the bathroom is.
I'd rather have a free bottle in front of me than a prefrontal lobotomy
Somebody left the cork out of my lunch
Drinking is a way of ending the day.
There was nothing really as glorious as a good beer shit - I mean after drinking twenty or twenty-five beers the night before. The odor of a beer shit like that spread all around and stayed for a good hour-and-a-half. It made you realize that you were really alive.
I feel sorry for people who don't drink. When they wake up in the morning, that's as good as they're going to feel all day
I drink to make other people interesting
Propaganda is a soft weapon; hold it in your hands too long, and it will move about like a snake, and strike the other way
One of the most horrible features of war is that all the war-propaganda, all the screaming and lies and hatred, comes invariably from people who are not fighting.
When any government, or any church for that matter, undertakes to say to its subjects, 'This you may not read, this you must not see, this you are forbidden to know,' the end result is tyranny and oppression, no matter how holy the motives. Mighty little force is needed to control a man whose mind has been hoodwinked; contrariwise, no amount of force can control a free man, a man whose mind is free. No, not the rack, not fission bombs, not anything'you can't conquer a free man; the most you can do is kill him.
Only the mob and the elite can be attracted by the momentum of totalitarianism itself. The masses have to be won by propaganda
Propaganda is to a democracy what the bludgeon is to a totalitarian state.
As societies grow decadent, the language grows decadent, too. Words are used to disguise, not to illuminate, action: You liberate a city by destroying it. Words are used to confuse, so that at election time people will solemnly vote against their own interests.
A great deal of intelligence can be invested in ignorance when the need for illusion is deep
Men, it has been well said, think in herds; it will be seen that they go mad in herds, while they only recover their senses slowly, and one by one 1841
He who wants to persuade should put his trust not in the right argument, but in the right word. The power of sound has always been greater than the power of sense
It is worthy of remark that a belief constantly inculcated during the early years of life, whilst the brain is impressible, appears to acquire almost the nature of an instinct; and the very essence of an instinct is that it is followed independently of reason
There once was a virtualization coder, Whose patches kept getting older, Each time upstream would drop, His documentation would slightly rot, SO APPLY MY F*$KING PATCHES OR I'LL KEEP WRITING LIMERICKS.
Just because code is clever doesn't mean it should go in. There are enough things in the kernel which have to be complex that we should always be on the lookout for things which can be made simpler.
The greatest problem of communication is the illusion that it has been accomplished.
It's not at all important to get it right the first time. It's vitally important to get it right the last time.
Learning is not compulsory. Neither is survival.
Good judgement comes from experience, and experience comes from bad judgement.
I have always found that plans are useless, but planning is indispensable.
Enjoying success requires the ability to adapt. Only by being open to change will you have a true opportunity to get the most from your talent.
In war as in life, it is often necessary when some cherished scheme has failed, to take up the best alternative open, and if so, it is folly not to work for it with all your might.
Anyone can dabble, but once you've made that commitment, your blood has that particular thing in it, and it's very hard for people to stop you.
One person with passion is better than forty people merely interested.
... Thous who are capable (and some that don't) use Pascal, the others, just say dou' (Homer Simpson like) every other line of code.
It was true that I didn't have much ambition, but there ought to be a place for people without ambition, I mean a better place than the one usually reserved. How in the hell could a man enjoy being awakened at 6:30 a.m. by an alarm clock, leap out of bed, dress, force-feed, shit, piss, brush teeth and hair, and fight traffic to get to a place where essentially you made lots of money for somebody else and were asked to be grateful for the opportunity to do so?
My job consists of basically masking my contempt for the assholes in charge, and, at least once a day, retiring to the men's room so I can jerk off while I fantasize about a life that doesn't so closely resemble Hell.
One of the saddest things is that the only thing that a man can do for eight hours a day, day after day, is work. You can't eat eight hours a day nor drink for eight hours a day nor make love for eight hours'all you can do for eight hours is work. Which is the reason why man makes himself and everybody else so miserable and unhappy.
Industrial man'a sentient reciprocating engine having a fluctuating output, coupled to an iron wheel revolving with uniform velocity. And then we wonder why this should be the golden age of revolution and mental derangement.
I see all this potential, and I see squandering. God damn it, an entire generation pumping gas, waiting tables'slaves with white collars. Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes, working jobs we hate so we can buy shit we don't need. We're the middle children of history, man. No purpose or place. We have no Great War. No Great Depression. Our Great War's a spiritual war . . . our Great Depression is our lives. We've all been raised on television to believe that one day we'd all be millionaires and movie gods and rock stars. But we won't. And we're slowly learning that fact. And we're very, very pissed off.
Work is the refuge of people who have nothing better to do.
For us to live any other way was nuts. Uh, to us, those goody-good people who worked shitty jobs for bum paychecks and took the subway to work every day, and worried about their bills, were dead. I mean they were suckers. They had no balls. If we wanted something we just took it. If anyone complained twice they got hit so bad, believe me, they never complained again.
But men labor under a mistake. The better part of the man is soon ploughed into the soil for compost. By a seeming fate, commonly called necessity, they are employed, as it says in the old book, laying up treasures which moth and rust will corrupt and thieves break through and steal. It is a fool's life, as they will find when they get to the end of it, if not before.
We don't have a lot of time on this earth! We weren't meant to spend it this way. Human beings were not meant to sit in little cubicles staring at computer screens all day, filling out useless forms and listening to eight different bosses drone on about about mission statements.
As you all know by now, this is the 51st annual Academy Awards. Two hours of sparkling entertainment spread out over a four-hour show.
Good evening, Hollywood phonies.
I never watched the Oscars. Come on, it's a fashion show . . . What straight black man sits there and watches the Oscars? Show me one. And they don't recognize comedy, and you don't see a lot of black people nominated, so why should I watch it?
The solemnity of the annual Nobel ceremonies in Stockholm with the cheerful bad taste of the grand opening of a shopping center in Los Angeles.
What does the Academy Award mean? I don't think it means much of anything.
I have no regard for that kind of ceremony. I just don't think they know what they're doing. When you see who wins those things'or who doesn't win them'you can see how meaningless this Oscar thing is.
Awards are meaningless for actors, unless they all play the same part.
The Academy Awards are obscene, dirty . . . no better than a beauty contest.
The (Academy Award) ceremonies are a two-hour meat parade, a public display with contrived suspense for economic reasons.
Hello, my name is Sacheen Littlefeather. I'm Apache and president of the National Native American Affirmative Action Committee. I'm representing Marlon Brando tonight and he's asked me to tell you in a very long speech which I cannot share with you presently because of time that he very regretfully cannot accept their very generous award and the reasons for this being the treatment of American Indians by the film industry.
Before I knowed it, I was sayin' out loud, 'The hell with it! There ain't no sin and there ain't no virtue. There's just stuff people do. It's all part of the same thing.'
Ravished! How ravished one could be without ever being touched. Ravished by dead words become obscene, and dead ideas become obsessions.
All this happened, more or less. The war parts, anyway, are pretty much true. One guy I knew really was shot in Dresden for taking a teapot that wasn't his. Another guy I knew really did threaten to have his personal enemies killed by hired gunmen after the war. And so on. I've changed all the names.
The one thing that doesn't abide by majority rule is a person's conscience.
The sun burnt every day. It burnt Time. The world rushed in a circle and turned on its axis and time was busy burning the years and the people anyway, without any help from him. So if he burnt things with the firemen and the sun burnt Time, that meant that everything burnt!
It was that kind of a crazy afternoon, terrifically cold, and no sun out or anything, and you felt like you were disappearing every time you crossed a road.
"I believe that today more than ever a book should be sought after even if it has only one great page in it. We must search for fragments, splinters, toenails, anything that has ore in it, anything that is capable of resuscitating the body and the soul.
The Planet drifts to random insect doom...
History...is a nightmare from which I am trying to awake.
Day by day and almost minute by minute the past was brought up to date. In this way every prediction made by the Party could be shown by documentary evidence to have been correct; nor was any item of news, or any expression of opinion, which conflicted with the needs of the moment, ever allowed to remain on record. All history was a palimpsest, scraped clean and reinscribed exactly as often as was necessary.
Christmas is awesome. First of all you get to spend time with people you love. Secondly, you can get drunk and no one can say anything. Third, you give presents. What's better than giving presents? And fourth, getting presents. So four things. Not bad for one day. It's really the greatest day of all time.
I hate Christmas. The mall is full of nothing but women and children. All you hear is 'I want this,' 'Get me this,' 'I have to have this' . . . and then there's the children. And they're all by my store 'cause they stuck the mall Santa right outside ringing his stupid bell. As if you need a bell to notice a 300-pound alcoholic in a red suit. 'Ho, ho, ho,' all day long. So, nice as can be, I go outside, ask him to shut the hell up. He takes a swing at me. So I lay a hook into his fat belly and he goes down. Beard comes off, all the kids start crying and I'm the bad guy.
You see Santa Claus tonight you better run boy, you better run for ya life! . . . You scared, ain't you? You should be! Christmas Eve is the scariest damn night of the year!
Mankind must put an end to war, or war will put an end to mankind
Many persons have a wrong idea of what constitutes true happiness. It is not attained through self-gratification but through fidelity to a worthy purpose.
When you know a thing, to hold that you know it; and when you do not know a thing, to allow that you do not know it - this is knowledge.
Reason and free inquiry are the only effectual agents against error.
There are only two ways by which to rise in this world, either by one's own industry or by the stupidity of others.
Every man has his follies -- and often they are the most interesting thing he had got.
You are only as wise as others perceive you to be.
The reasonable man adapts himself to the world; the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man.
And when it rains on your parade, look up rather than down. Without the rain, there would be no rainbow.
The great thing about mod_rewrite is it gives you all the configurability and flexibility of Sendmail. The downside to mod_rewrite is that it gives you all the configurability and flexibility of Sendmail.

Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later!
The best way to get a project done faster is to start sooner
Even the best planning is not so omniscient as to get it right the first time
How does a project get to be a year late?... One day at a time.
The bearing of a child takes nine months, no matter how many women are assigned. Many software tasks have this characteristic because of the sequential nature of debugging
Plan to throw one (implementation) away; you will, anyhow
Every good work of software starts by scratching a developer's personal itch
Perfection (in design) is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but rather when there is nothing more to take away
Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.
Program testing can be used to show the presence of bugs, but never to show their absence!
The belief that complex systems require armies of designers and programmers is wrong. A system that is not understood in its entirety, or at least to a significant degree of detail by a single individual, should probably not be built.
A primary cause of complexity is that software vendors uncritically adopt almost any feature that users want.
Prolific programmers contribute to certain disaster.
Documentation is the castor oil of programming. Managers think it is good for programmers and programmers hate it!.
Good code is its own best documentation. As you're about to add a comment, ask yourself, 'How can I improve the code so that this comment isn't needed?' Improve the code and then document it to make it even clearer.
It's OK to figure out murder mysteries, but you shouldn't need to figure out code. You should be able to read it.
It's better to wait for a productive programmer to become available than it is to wait for the first available programmer to become productive.
An organization that treats its programmers as morons will soon have programmers that are willing and able to act like morons only.
Design and programming are human activities; forget that and all is lost.
Before software can be reusable it first has to be usable.
If you think your management doesn't know what it's doing or that your organisation turns out low-quality software crap that embarrasses you, then leave.
Real programmers can write assembly code in any language.
Up to a point, it is better to just let the snags [bugs] be there than to spend such time in design that there are none.
The price of reliability is the pursuit of the utmost simplicity. It is a price which the very rich may find hard to pay.
There are two ways of constructing a software design: One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies, and the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies. The first method is far more difficult.
You cannot teach beginners top-down programming, because they don't know which end is up.
Inside every large program, there is a small program trying to get out.
The key to performance is elegance, not battalions of special cases.
Why do we never have time to do it right, but always have time to do it over?
The goal of Computer Science is to build something that will last at least until we've finished building it
Better train people and risk they leave - than do nothing and risk they stay
Optimism is an occupational hazard of programming: feedback is the treament
Good judgment comes from experience, and experience comes from bad judgment.
When to use iterative development? You should use iterative development only on projects that you want to succeed.
Simple things should be simple, complex things should be possible.
Simplicity is the soul of efficiency.
... with proper design, the features come cheaply. This approach is arduous, but continues to succeed.
A good way to stay flexible is to write less code
The best performance improvement is the transition from the nonworking state to the working state.
More computing sins are committed in the name of efficiency (without necessarily achieving it) than for any other single reason - including blind stupidity.
The competent programmer is fully aware of the strictly limited size of his own skull; therefore he approaches the programming task in full humility, and among other things he avoids clever tricks like the plague.
Correctness is clearly the prime quality. If a system does not do what it is supposed to do, then everything else about it matters little.
One principle problem of educating software engineers is that they will not use a new method until they believe it works and, more importantly, that they will not believe the method will work until they see it for themselves.
Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it.
Make everything as simple as possible, but not simpler.
Increasingly, people seem to misinterpret complexity as sophistication, which is baffling --- the incomprehensible should cause suspicion rather than admiration.
If you cannot grok the overall structure of a program while taking a shower, you are not ready to code it.
You can't have great software without a great team, and most software teams behave like dysfunctional families.
The perfect project plan is possible if one first documents a list of all the unknowns.
If something is worth doing once, it's worth building a tool to do it
Always code as if the person who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live
... programming requires more concentration than other activities. It's the reason programmers get upset about 'quick interruptions' - such interruptions are tantamount to asking a juggler to keep three balls in the air and hold your groceries at the same time."
When debugging, novices insert corrective code; experts remove defective code.
Every big computing disaster has come from taking too many ideas and putting them in one place.
Conceptual integrity is the most important consideration in system design.
Experience doesn't necessarily teach anything.
No matter what the problem is, it's always a people problem.
Hiring people to write code to sell is not the same as hiring people to design and build durable, usable, dependable software.
The wisdom of the wise and the experience of the ages are perpetuated in quotations.
We try to solve the problem by rushing through the design process so that enough time is left at the end of the project to uncover the errors that were made because we rushed through the design process.
Programs should be written and polished until they acquire publication quality
Time pressure gradually corrupts an engineer's standard of quality and perfection. It has a detrimental effect on people as well as products.
Good engineering is characterized by gradual, stepwise refinement of products that yields increased performance under given constraints and with given resources.
Software expands to fill the available memory.
Software is getting slower more rapidly than hardware becomes faster.
My goal is to make the computer invisible.
Always honor the system color settings, that is, the colors that the user chose in the control panel. Users have deliberately chosen those colors to give their computer the color scheme they like. Also, many of your vision-impaired users have deliberately set up schemes that they can see more clearly. (For that matter, always honor they system fonts so that your text is readable by people who prefer larger fonts.)
Trying to improve software quality by increasing the amount of testing is like trying to lose weight by weighing yourself more often.
Fifty years of programming language research, and we end up with C++ ???
C++: Hard to learn and built to stay that way
C++ is like teenage sex:
Writing in C or C++ is like running a chain saw with all the safety guards removed
Ever spend a little time reading comp.lang.c++ ? That's really the best place to learn about the number of C++ users looking for a better language.
The evolution of languages: FORTRAN is a non-typed language. C is a weakly typed language. Ada is a strongly typed language. C++ is a strongly hyped language
C(++) is a write-only, high-level assembler language.
C++ has it's place in the history of programming languages. Just as Caligula has his place in the history of the Roman Empire ?
C++ : Where friends have access to your private members.
C++ would make a decent teaching language if we could teach the ++ part without the C part.
The great thing about Object Oriented code is that it can make small, simple problems look like large, complex ones
In C++ it's harder to shoot yourself in the foot, but when you do, you blow off your whole leg.
Top 5 reasons to buy a crappy C++ book:  5 -- You won't read it anyway  4 -- It comes out of your company's wallet, not yours  3 -- It's the only language left that doesn't try to be "write once, run on any toaster oven"  2 -- You still can't figure out how pointers work  1 -- It's still less crappy than the writing on Slashdot
When your hammer is C++, everything begins to look like a thumb.
One of the main causes of the fall of the Roman Empire was that, lacking zero, they had no way to indicate successful termination of their C programs
I have stopped reading Stephen King novels. Now I just read C code instead.
C++ is an atrocity, the bletcherous scab of the computing world, responsible for more buffer overflows, more security breaches, more blue screens of death, more mysterious failures than any other computer language in the history of the planet Earth.
Arguing that Java is better than C++ is like arguing that grasshoppers taste better than tree bark.
If C++ has taught me one thing, it's this: Just because the system is consistent doesn't mean it's not the work of Satan.
Being really good at C++ is like being really good at using rocks to sharpen sticks.
If you think C++ is not overly complicated, just what is a protected abstract virtual base pure virtual private destructor and when was the last time you needed one?
In My Egotistical Opinion, most people's C programs should be indented six feet downward and covered with dirt.
A system composed of 100,000 lines of C++ is not be sneezed at, but we don't have that much trouble developing 100,000 lines of COBOL today. The real test of OOP will come when systems of 1 to 10 million lines of code are developed.
C has all the expressive power of two dixie cups and a string.
Within C++, there is a much smaller and cleaner language struggling to get out.
I invented the term Object-Oriented, and I can tell you I did not have C++ in mind.
There are only two things wrong with C++: The initial concept and the implementation.
C++ will do for C what Algol-68 did for Algol.
C is often described, with a mixture of fondness and disdain varying according to the speaker, as "a language that combines all the elegance and power of assembly language with all the readability and maintainability of assembly language."
C++ is the only current language making COBOL look good.
PL/I and Ada started out with all the bloat, were very daunting languages, and got bad reputations (deservedly). C++ has shown that if you slowly bloat up a language over a period of years, people don't seem to mind as much.
Java is, in many ways, C++--.
You can't prove anything about a program written in C or FORTRAN. It's really just Peek and Poke with some syntactic sugar.
C is quirky, flawed and an enormous success.
Eiffel borrows quite heavily from some earlier programming languages and I am sure that if we had found a good programming construct in C we would have used it as well.
A C program is like a fast dance on a newly waxed dance floor by people carrying razors.
All C programs do the same thing: look at a character and do nothing with it.
Whenever the C++ language designers had two competing ideas as to how they should solve some problem, they said, "OK, we'll do them both". So the language is too baroque for my taste.
The last good thing written in C++ was the Pachelbel Canon.
Other advanced languages, such as assembler and C, were not terribly complex in themselves, but the environments in which applications were developed were downright weird, with mines scattered about everywhere, ready to blow the inattentive programmer out of the water.
Going from programming in Pascal to programming in C, is like learning to write in Morse code.
To me C++ seems to be a language that has sacrificed orthogonality and elegance for random expediency.
Any sufficiently complicated C or Fortran program contains an ad hoc informally-specified bug-ridden slow implementation of half of Common Lisp.
C++ is history repeated as tragedy. Java is history repeated as farce.
Unix and C are the ultimate computer viruses.
It has been discovered that C++ provides a remarkable facility for concealing the trival details of a program -- such as where its bugs are.
I view the landslide of C use in education as something of a calamity.
C++ is like jamming a helicopter inside a Miata and expecting some sort of improvement.
Pointers are like jumps, leading wildly from one part of the data structure to another. Their introduction into high-level languages has been a step backwards from which we may never recover.
C++: Simula in wolf's clothing.
The belief is still widespread in the commputing community that C and its derivatives are programming languages -- languages intended for people to write programs in. This is a regrettable misunderstanding.
From a practical viewpoint, it's easy to see that C will always be with us, taking a place beside Fortran and Cobol as the right tool for certain jobs.
I consider C++ the most significant technical hazard to the survival of your project and do so without apologies.

When finlly you understand life, you finish your own  quando compreenderes a vida, acabas com a tua
The first 90 percent of the code accounts for the first 90 percent of the development time... The remaining 10 percent of the code accounts for the other 90 percent of the development time.
Most of you are familiar with the virtues of a programmer. There are three, of course: laziness, impatience, and hubris.
Measuring programming progress by lines of code is like measuring aircraft building progress by weight.
In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. But, in practice, there is.
The hardest part of design... is keeping features out.
If debugging is the process of removing bugs, then programming must be the process of putting them in.
Software and cathedrals are much the same - first we build them, then we pray.
The software isn't finished until the last user is dead.
Programming is 10% science, 20% ingenuity, and 70% getting the ingenuity to work with the science.
All programmers are playwrights and all computers are lousy actors
Bad code isn't bad, its just misunderstood.
It is easier to measure something than to understand what you have measured.
The sooner you get behind in your work, the more time you have to catch up.
When a programming language is created that allows programmers to program in simple English, it will be discovered that programmers cannot speak English.
Benchmarks don't lie, but liars do benchmarks
Your code does not start at the compiler nor does it stop at the JVM
One lesson that most developers don't learn is to debug outside the debugger. As an engineer there are times when you need to troubleshot, problem solve, and debug not just your software from the comforts of your favorite IDE but the whole software stack, network, hardware, user's environment, and even the user himself.
You can unit test and statically analysis software, but you can't probe your users.
Every problem, issue, and bug experienced by the end user directly and indirectly with your software eventually needs to be implicitly and explicitly dealt with by your software development team.
I wish development teams spend more time streamlining their process rather than prematurely optimizing their code
It is OK to have software with bugs, bugs can be fixed. It is not OK to have software with excuses!
Learn, plan, design, code, integrate, build, release, rinse, and repeat.
Management has a way of over emphasizing the blatantly obvious
I've discovered that Windows security is an oxymoron!
I know that techies, myself included, are always bragging about how their code is poetry but I have never meet a poet laureate in a development team.
Remixing and mashing up Google Maps and Flickr is like the 'Hello, World' first program of Web 2.0 mashups.
Open Source code equals community.
As a rule of thumb, I never cache, pool, or use as singleton mutable objects
Bugs by nature are out of the box, as a developer, you need to expand the box.
WWGD: What would Google do?
At some companies, the term Spec stands for Speculation
I went to school to learn how to program software applications, which inevitably have bug defects. There was no course at my university on testing, debugging, profiling, or optimization. These things you have to learn on your own, usually in a tight deadline.
To most Java developers, Ruby/Rails is like a mistress. Ruby/Rails is young, new, and exciting; but eventually we go back to old faithful, dependable, and employable Java with some new tricks and idioms and we are the better programmer for it.
You might as well hire your customers and pay them 50K/year because they are your new QA.
There is a saying, those who can, do; those who can't, teach. It can be said that in software engineering, those who can, code, those who can't, manage.
The greatest thing about Ruby on Rails is neither Ruby nor Rails, the best aspect of Rails is that it questioned the 'best practices' (and worst nightmares) of the current state of web development with its philosophy of Convention over Configuration and Don't Repeat Yourself principle.
There is more than one way to do it, but do it how ever more than one developer can understand it.
Design a software solution for the end user, not for a fellow developer, or worse yet your database.
If the end user can't use your software, that's a bug.
You may consider your code as art but no one is going to hang your code in the Louvre
Use the quicksort approach to problem solving.
Having code working on the developer's machine is not a valid solution, software needs to work at the client's site too!
The anti-FUD: Fighting FUD with more FUD
Unfortunately, there is no performance enhancement supplement you can take to make you a better software engineer.
Even the best process and best technology fail, if the people fail. People often fail, when management fails to provide the right incentive, motivation, and passion-oriented environment that people like to be a part of.
Failure is a form of experience.
Everyone has their own way of learning and should be granted the opportunity to digest information as they know how to learn best, whether it is through documentation, screen shots, class diagrams, use cases, prototyping, refactoring, and even rewriting.
It is commonly said that you don't know what you have until you lose it. With software you usually don't know what the user will want until you ship.
As a developer, it is not like we get royalties on our work, so what do I care that 5% of my software is pirated, those that do pay for it make up the perceived loss.
Software companies should listen to their customers, even those that use their software a few times, instead of their lawyers, that most likely never have used their software.
Every piece of code has bugs, but not every bug needs to be in the code.
Testing is not a one time, one shot deal. Testing is like marriage, you have to work at it every day for it to be successful.
I don't hire software engineers to code. The primary function of an software engineer is to learn and analysis and decode a problem mentally so that then can later code their language of choice.
Software engineering is nothing like civil engineering. Software engineers listen too much to their end users. If civil engineers listen to their users as much we would software developers do most buildings would end up like the Winchester Mystery House with a freeway offramp coming right up to their driveway.
This feature might have been due yesterday, but telling me a day after it is due is not a schedule!
A business laptop given to a knowledge worker should be treated such as a marine treats his issued assault weapon, with the utmost respect and intimate knowledge of its inner workings. A business laptop is usually loaded with sensitive and proprietary information, and it is just pathetic when someone can't change the display on their own machine to use a projector.
If you don't understand Open Source licensing, don't start an Open Source project. Keep your code!
The real value of code does not lie in the source code, the value lies in the knowledge and expertize of the community.
For every one line of code in jQuery, there is at least one plugin written by a third party.
There cannot be a killer app without a killer community.
The easier it is to reproduce a bug, the easier it is to fix.
You can't have five top priorities at once.
As a software engineer, it is better to think of yourself as ninja programmer rather than a mercenary coder.
Its not a team meeting if only one person talks, that's more like a presentation.
The anatomy of a Google application is sheer simplicity, great user interface and experience, accessible data API, and instant scalability.
A properly written application might scale to millions of users, a top developer at most can scale to a few tasks a day.
A programming language shouldn't change it's accent in every major point release. This is also true about libraries, frameworks, and APIs.
Adhering to a process is like a freeway, when everyone is going at sustainable developer velocity, the process is flowing. But it only takes one developer to stall in the middle of the process to back up and side rail the whole team, as one stalled car in the freeway backs up everybody.
In the end, all software end up the same, just a bunch of boxes wired together.
Software development teams are like Tolstoy's Family, there is a one way to produce happy software, but unlimited number of ways to be down trodden frustrated and dysfunctional software.
Measuring programming progress by lines of code is like measuring a horror flick by the number of victims, for either case it's usually a gorefest.
As software developers, half the stuff we do is hacks for the other half.
Don't let the spec define and technology limit user experience.
Software engineering wants to be a creative, like writing, and disciplined, like engineering, but it is often neither.
Remember that process is there to help people, not people to push along the process.
I've heard of greenfield app, now brownfield app. A brownfield that contaminated by poor practices but has the potential to be revived. What is next? Cloverfield?
The only thing I hate most other writing unit tests, is refactoring, updating, and maintaining code that do not have unit tests.
In most applications you'll ever develop, optimization and scalability are just 10% of the job. Focus on the 90%, which is getting the thing to work correctly.
Learning a new platform requires you learn a whole set of known issues and limitations, and to discover new ones in the process.
Anyone eager to deploy a web application on a new framework is a masochist.
Backward compatibility is not just about code but also applies to usability. Backward compatible is about implies to user expectations.
Rails is not just opinionated software, it is fascist software.
The Java version of a Hello World example Web Services using Axis 2 is just about ten lines of code, 55 jars, and 20MB war file. Fail.
Everyone has ideas, ideas are a cheap commodity. Visualizing an idea for five minutes is not the same thing as working years to actualize it.
Not every cloud computing initiative has a silver lining.
Big O notation is used to describe computational complexity, I use Big H notation to describe the level of a hack. H(n!) describes a MacGyver level hack. Similarly there is a Big F notation for level of FAIL.
In programming there is force of nature or grace of God, just hacks of probability and redundancy.
Saying that it will be fixed in the a future release does not fix the problem.
When hiring, I'll take someone that wants to do it over someone that has done it once and is willing to do it again until something better comes along. That is the difference between passion and bandwagon, career man and salary man, patriot and mercenary, love and prostitution.
If all things are equal and fully qualify, hire those that want to be there, contract those that just need to be somewhere.
It doesn't matter how smart you are, or how smart I think I am. Regression testing will prove us wrong.
I have heard that some teams follow the Software Development Life Cycle. But I have seen teams follow the Software Development Death March.
Recruit. Retain. Retrain.
Some entrepreneurs idea of a business model is how much they can charge their customers not what they can do for them.
Some entrepreneurs are looking for a sexy business model, I'll stick to my hard working homely business model.
Service provider: Good, Fast, Cheap. Pick two. Employee: passionate, knowledgeable, productive. Pick one.
When people are too busy to learn, they are not being productive.
Which is best, an extraordinary idea executed ordinary and ordinary idea executed extraordinary?
Learn to manage your manager.
You could only be excellent, you can't be half excellent
You can only stand in front of a client only if you know what you say you know.
You can't charge for testing, but it saves you time and money, it is an investment in quality and sanity.
The problem with frameworks is that you most often have a very narrow frame to work with.
Don't stay in bed, unless you can make money in bed.
If you are spending more time writing code than thinking about what code you should write - you are doing something wrong. Very wrong. Or it's something trivial enough to not be of much importance. Or it's Java.
Those who do not understand Unix are condemned to reinvent it, poorly.
Evolution always seems to win out over revolution when it comes to technology.
C++ is popular because it is like C. Java is popular because it is like C++ and C. C# is popular because it is like Java. See a pattern
Process makes us strong. ... Process allows us to draw pretty charts and graphs on endless presentations.
I really think types are the fundamental currency of Java, not strings.
Don't be a corporate programmer. They demand all of your creativity and trust none of your judgment.
I really think a major problem in our industry is that programmers turn their brains off when someone with a Ph.D. or who's written a book makes a statement.
Don't just fucking blog, but write some software and give it away. While the average person can only read a human language, the people you really need to hit with your message as a programmer are other coders.
The programmer who programs least, programs best.
Well, it has been said over and over again that the tremendous cost of programming is caused by the fact that it is done by cheap labor, which makes it very expensive, and secondly that people rush into coding.
The biggest issue on software teams is making sure everyone understands what everyone else is doing.
You should be 95% certain that a candidate would be a great hire before they ever set foot in an interview room.
What software developers do best is learn.
Saying you understand SQL is the best way of getting me to ask you to design a table to describe a hierarchical structure or give a talk on concurrency.
For instance, ideas at Google do not burst forth from the heads of geniuses and then find their way unimpeded to huge audiences of receptive users. Rather ideas emerge, are torn to shreds, reformulated, torn to shreds, prototyped, torn to shreds, launched to internal users, torn to shreds, rebuilt and relaunched, torn to shreds, refined some more, torn to shreds, put back together one last time, torn to shreds by SREs, tweaked again in a seemingly-endless frenzy of last minute work, and launched...whereupon they are torn to shreds by bloggers, journalists, and competitors. The magic of Google is that tearing to shreds...
why is it that the software development industry, which has all these awesome ways of sharing what has previously been done, constantly finds itself reinventing the wheel?
Building Facebook Applications is not a business plan, unless you are a web developer who does freelance Facebook application development. It is the McDonalds equivalent of a business plan. Quick, cheap, greasy and ultimately unfulfilling.
Software is error-ridden in part because of its growing complexity. The size of software products is no longer measured in thousands of lines of code, but in millions. Software developers already spend approximately 80 percent of development costs on identifying and correcting defects, and yet few products of any type other than software are shipped with such high levels of errors.
While machines have changed enormously, the business of software development has been rather static. We still spend most of our time working n requirements and specification, the low-tech part of our work.
Productivity within the software industry has improved by three to five percent a year, only marginally better than the steel or automobile industry.
Count on the best people outperforming the worst by about 10:1. Count on the best performer being about 2.5 times better than the median performer.
People who had ten years of experience did not outperform those with two years of experience.
There was a very weak relationship between salary and performance.
The business we're in is more sociological then technological, more dependent on workers' abilities to communicate with each other than their abilities to communicate with machines.
Having a resume begs for you to go into that big machine that looks for relevant keywords, and begs for you to get a job as a cog in a giant machine.
The flip side of code ownership is code responsibility.
The First Rule of Programming: It's Always Your Fault
Stop being a software factory, write a software factory.
Programming books sold by weight, not by volume.
People who talk big about scalability don't need to worry about it
Dude, your app isn't having scalability problems because of the architecture. It's having scalability problems because you coded a ton of N^2 loops into it and you're too self-important to get peer reviews on your commits.
If you haven't discussed capacity planning, you can't discuss scalability
Unless you know what you need to scale to, you can't even begin to talk about scalability.
Choosing technology don't mean shit if you don't know how to use it
Buying new software should require product research, multiple demos, on-site testing, reference checking, and planning
The bottleneck in writing code isn't in the writing of the code, it's in understanding and conceptualising what needs to be done.
I use a variety of languages, tools, and OSes, and my choice of which to use are all geared around a single end goal: not to promote my own social or political agenda, but to make my customer happy.
For all those who don't get it, languages don't scale, architectures do.
Faster means cheaper, it doesn't mean more scalable.
We are not solving problems, we are approximating solutions.
All problems of scale become a network problem.
Programming in of itself is just an activity, like brushing your teeth. In the same way brushing your teeth doesn't make you a dentist, writing code doesn't make you an engineer, artist, or scientist.
If you want to create a memorable company, you have to fill your company with memorable people.
From what I've seen of it, PHP isn't so much a language as a random collection of arbitrary stuff, a virtual explosion at the keyword and function factory.
All the PHP code I've seen in that experience has been messy, unmaintainable crap. Spaghetti SQL wrapped in spaghetti PHP wrapped in spaghetti HTML, replicated in slightly-varying form in dozens of places.
One day, you may need a super-scalable architecture to keep up with the traffic. But before that, it's more important to focus on building a great software that makes people happy.
The Golden Rule of Data Manipulation: It is always easier and more flexible to combine data elements rather than to break them apart.
Is the community around a product more important than the product itself?
Most programming languages contain good parts and bad parts. I discovered that I could be better programmer by using only the good parts and avoiding the bad parts.
It turns out that strong typing does not eliminate the need for careful testing. And I have found in my work that the sorts of errors that strong type checking finds are no the errors I worry about.
Obsolete comments are worse than no comments.
Generally, the craft of programming is the factoring of a set of requirements into a set of functions and data structures.
Software is usually expected to be modified over the course of its productive life. The process of converting one correct program into a different correct program is extremely challenging.
It turns out that style matters in programming for the same reason that it matters in writing. It makes for better reading.
Features have a specification cost, a design cost, and a development cost. There is a testing cost and a reliability cost. ... Features have a documentation cost. Every feature adds pages to the manual increasing training costs.
Features that offer value to a minority of users impose a cost on all users.
The worst interview question is the question taken out of context.
Efficiency and quality are of equal importance!! Both come from experience, not from study. Study as you go, don't assume that you're ready for the real world because you studied first.
The [iPhone] SDK has more restrictions than Guantanamo.
Closures are the new web framework, everybody wants one.
I admit it, programming pleases me sexually.
It's as easy to hire great Ruby programmers as it is to hire great Java programmers or great programmers for any given popular language. The problem is, it's not easy to hire great programmers in any language.
50% of all people doing business software development should find a new profession.
Creativity is your most important asset in development, and the first one to go with sleep deprivation.
The art of programming is finding patterns where others see only chaos.
The chief cause of problems is solutions.
The user is NOT a lower life form
True interactivity is not about clicking on icons or downloading files, it's about encouraging communication.
A picture is worth a thousand words. An interface is worth a thousand pictures.
The joy of an early release lasts but a short time. The bitterness of an unusable system lasts for years.
If we want users to like our software, we should design it to behave like a likeable person.
Any darn fool can make something complex; it takes a genius to make something simple.
Never use a warning when you mean undo.
If you need the approval of the platform vendor to ship an app, then it isn't a platform.
Marketing has long known how to exploit fads and how to develop trends.
As a buying group, visionaries are easy to sell but very hard to please. This is because they are buying a dream - which, to some degree, will alwasy be a dream.
The biggest problem is typically overly ambitious expectations combined with undercapitalization.
To enter the maintsteam market is an act of aggression. The companies who have already established relationships with your target customer will resent your intrusion and do everything they can to shut you out.
The sooner you start to code, the longer the program will take.
If the code and the comments disagree, then both are probably wrong.
If you have too many special cases, you are doing it wrong.
Testing can show the presence of bugs, not their absence.
Each new user of a new system uncovers a new class of bugs.
The fastest algorithm can frequently be replaced by one that is almost as fast and much easier to understand.
Whenever possible, steal code.
I would rather write programs to help me write programs than write programs.
Furious activity is no substitute for understanding.
One person's constant is another person's variable.
One person's data is another person's program.
The computer industry is the only industry that is more fashion-driven than women's fashion.
When in doubt, use brute force.
Avoid arc-sine and arc-cosine functions---you can usually do better by applying a trig identity or computing a vector dot-product.
Allocate four digits for the year part of a date: a new millennium is approaching.
Avoid asymmetry.
If you can't write it down in English, you can't code it.
Details count.
Get your data structures correct first, and the rest of the program will write itself.
A program designed for inputs from people is usually stressed beyond breaking point by computer-generated inputs.
Twenty percent of all input forms filled by people contain bad data.
Eighty percent of all input forms ask questions they have no business asking.
Don't make the user interface provide information that the system already knows.
For 80% of all data sets, 95% of the information can be seen in a good graph.
Do you really need to scale this now when you have two users per day ?!
Premature scaling is a root for bad design
Of all my programming bugs, 80% are syntax errors. Of the remaining 20%, 80% are trivial logical errors. Of the remaining 4%, 80% are pointer errors. And the remaining 0.8% are hard.
It takes three times the effort to find and fix bugs in system test than when done by the developer. It takes ten times the effort to find and fix bugs in the field than when done in system test. Therefore, insist on unit tests by the developer.
Don't debug standing up. It cuts your patience in half, and you need all you can muster.
Don't get suckered in by the comments---they can be terribly misleading. Debug only code.
If it ain't broke, don't fix it.
If we can't fix it, it ain't broke.
The first step in fixing a broken program is getting it to fail repeatably.
The First Rule of Program Optimization: don't do it. The Second Rule of Program Optimization: Don't do it yet
In non-I/O-bound programs, less than four percent of a program generally accounts for more than half of its running time.
Before optimizing, use a profiler to locate the "hot spots" of the program.
When you turn an ordinary page of code into just a handful of instructions for speed, expand the comments to keep the number of source lines constant.
Good code document itself, great code use good comments as part of it's documentation.
If the programmer can simulate a construct faster than a compiler can implement the construct itself, then the compiler writer has blown it badly.
To speed up an I/O-bound program, begin by accounting for all I/O. Eliminate that which is unnecessary or redundant, and make the remaining as fast as possible.
The fastest I/O is no I/O.
The cheapest, fastest and most reliable components of a computer system are those that aren't there.
Most assembly languages have a loop operation that does a compare and branch in a single machine instruction; although it was intended for loops, it can sometimes be used to do a general comparison very efficiently.
Making a wrong program worse is no sin.
Electricity travels a foot in a nanosecond.
Don't include a sentence in documentation if its negation is obviously false.
When explaining a command, or language feature, or hardware widget, first describe the problem it is designed to solve.
A {specification, design, procedure, test plan} that will not fit on one page of 8.5-by-11 inch paper cannot be understood.
The job's not over until the paperwork's done.
The structure of a system reflects the structure of the organization that built it.
Don't keep doing what doesn't work.
The first 90% of the code accounts for the first 90% of the development time. The remaining 10% of the code accounts for the other 90% of the development time.
Less than 10% of the code has to do with the ostensible purpose of the system; the rest deals with input-output, data validation, data structure maintenance, and other housekeeping.
Don't write a new program if one already does more or less what you want. And if you must write a program, use existing code to do as much of the work as possible.
Good customer relations double productivity.
Translating a working program to a new language or system takes ten percent of the original development time or manpower or cost.
Don't use the computer to do things that can be efficiently done by hand.
Don't use hands to do things that can be efficiently done by the computer.
Brooks's Law of Prototypes: Plan to throw one away, you will anyhow.
If you plan to throw one away, you will throw away two.
Prototyping cuts the work to produce a system by 40%.
Thompson's Rule for First-Time Telescope Makers: It is faster to make a four-inch mirror and then a six-inch mirror than to make a six-inch mirror.
Always do the hard part first. If the hard part is impossible, why waste time on the easy part? Once the hard part is done, you're home free.  Always do the east part first. What you think at first is the easy part often turns out to be the hard part. Once the easy part is done, you can concentrate all your efforts on the hard part.
Sure, 90% of all software is crap. That's because 90% of everything is crap.
If you lie to the computer, it will get you.
If a system doesn't have to be reliable, it can do anything else.
KISS: Keep it simple, stupid.
Eschew clever rules.
I head a nation of a million presidents.
Miracles sometimes occur, but one has to work terribly hard for them.
Restlessness and discontent are the first necessities of progress.
An idea is something that won't work unless you do.
Anything that won't sell, I don't want to invent. Its sale is proof of utility, and utility is success.
As a cure for worrying, work is better than whiskey.
Be courageous. I have seen many depressions in business. Always America has emerged from these stronger and more prosperous. Be brave as your fathers before you. Have faith! Go forward!
Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the Western Spiral arm of the Galaxy lies a small unregarded yellow sun. Orbiting this at a distance of roughly ninety-eight million miles is an utterly insignificant little blue-green planet whose ape-descended life forms are so amazingly primitive that they still think digital watches are a pretty neat idea.
It is not the fall that kills you. It's the sudden stop at the end.
A common mistake people make when trying to design something completely foolproof is to underestimate the ingenuity of complete fools
Anyone who is capable of getting themselves made President should on no account be allowed to do the job.
Flying is learning how to throw yourself at the ground and miss.
He felt that his whole life was some kind of dream and he sometimes wondered whose it was and whether they were enjoying it.
He hoped and prayed that there wasn't an afterlife. Then he realized there was a contradiction involved here and merely hoped that there wasn't an afterlife.
Human beings, who are almost unique in having the ability to learn from the experience of others, are also remarkable for their apparent disinclination to do so.
I refuse to answer that question on the grounds that I don't know the answer.
Isn't it enough to see that a garden is beautiful without having to believe that there are fairies at the bottom of it too?
Life is wasted on the living.
The moment at which two people, approaching from opposite ends of a long passageway, recognize each other and immediately pretend they haven't. This is to avoid the ghastly embarrassment of having to continue recognizing each other the whole length of the corridor.
There is a theory which states that if ever anybody discovers exactly what the Universe is for and why it is here, it will instantly disappear and be replaced by something even more bizarre and inexplicable. There is another theory which states that this has already happened.
To give real service you must add something which cannot be bought or measured with money, and that is sincerity and integrity.
What to do if you find yourself stuck in a crack in the ground underneath a giant boulder you can't move, with no hope of rescue. Consider how lucky you are that life has been good to you so far. Alternatively, if life hasn't been good to you so far, which given your current circumstances seems more likely, consider how lucky you are that it won't be troubling you much longer.
All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.
All issues are political issues, and politics itself is a mass of lies, evasions, folly, hatred and schizophrenia.
At any given moment, there is a sort of all pervading orthodoxy, a general tacit agreement not to discuss large and uncomfortable facts.
If liberty means anything at all, it means the right to tell people what they do not want to hear.
In a time of universal deceit - telling the truth is a revolutionary act
Political or military commentators, like astrologers, can survive almost any mistake, because their more devoted followers do not look to them for an appraisal of the facts but for the stimulation of nationalistic loyalties.
A dirty joke is a sort of mental rebellion.
A liberal is a power worshipper without the power.
A tragic situation exists precisely when virtue does not triumph but when it is still felt that man is nobler than the forces which destroy him.
All people who have reached the point of becoming nations tend to despise foreigners, but there is not much doubt that the English-speaking races are the worst offenders. One can see this from the fact that as soon as they become fully aware of any foreign race they invent an insulting nickname for it.
All writers are vain, selfish and lazy, and at the very bottom of their motives lies a mystery. Writing a book is a long, exhausting struggle, like a long bout of some painful illness. One would never undertake such a thing if one were not driven by some demon whom one can neither resist nor understand.
As with the Christian religion, the worst advertisement for socialism is its adherents.
At 50, everyone has the face he deserves.
Autobiography is only to be trusted when it reveals something disgraceful. A man who gives a good account of himself is probably lying, since any life when viewed from the inside is simply a series of defeats.
But the thing that I saw in your face no power can disinherit: No bomb that ever burst shatters the crystal spirit.
Doublethink means the power of holding two contradictory beliefs in one's mind simultaneously, and accepting both of them.
Early in life I had noticed that no event is ever correctly reported in a newspaper.
Enlightened people seldom or never possess a sense of responsibility.
For a creative writer possession of the "truth" is less important than emotional sincerity.
Four legs good, two legs bad.
Freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two make four. If that is granted, all else follows.
Good novels are not written by orthodoxy-sniffers, nor by people who are conscience-stricken about their own orthodoxy. Good novels are written by people who are not frightened.
He is a man of thirty-five, but looks fifty. He is bald, has varicose veins and wears spectacles, or would wear them if his only pair were not chronically lost. If things are normal with him, he will be suffering from malnutrition, but if he has recently had a lucky streak, he will be suffering from a hangover. At present, it is half past eleven in the morning, and according to his schedule he should have started work two hours ago; but even if he had made any serious effort to start, he would have been frustrated by the almost continuous ringing of the telephone bell, the yells of the baby, the rattle of an electric drill out in the street, and the heavy boots of his creditors clumping up the stairs. The most recent interruption was the arrival of the second post, which brought him two circulars and an income tax demand printed in red. Needless to say, this person is a writer.
He is as antisocial as a flea. Clearly, such people are undesirable, and a society in which they can flourish has something wrong with it.
He is fiddling while Rome is burning, and, unlike the enormous majority of people who do this, fiddling with his face towards the flames.
He left behind, as his essential contribution to literature, a large repertoire of jokes which survive because of their sheer neatness, and because of a certain intriguing uncertainty - which extends to Wilde himself - as to whether they really mean anything.
He who controls the past commands the future. He who commands the future conquers the past.
I sometimes think that the price of liberty is not so much eternal vigilance as eternal dirt.
If you want a vision of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face - forever.
In every one of those little stucco boxes there's some poor bastard who's never free except when he's fast asleep and dreaming that he's got the boss down the bottom of a well and is bunging lumps of coal at him.
In our time, political speech and writing are largely the defence of the indefensible.
Joyce is a poet and also an elephantine pedant.
Language ought to be the joint creation of poets and manual workers.
Men are only as good as their technical development allows them to be.
Men can only be happy when they do not assume that the object of life is happiness.
Most people get a fair amount of fun out of their lives, but on balance life is suffering, and only the very young or the very foolish imagine otherwise.
Most revolutionaries are potential Tories, because they imagine that everything can be put right by altering the shape of society; once that change is effected, as it sometimes is, they see no need for any other.
Myths which are believed in tend to become true.
Nationalism is power hunger tempered by self-deception.
No advance in wealth, no softening of manners, no reform or revolution has ever brought human equality a millimetre nearer.
No one can look back on his schooldays and say with truth that they were altogether unhappy.
Not to expose your true feelings to an adult seems to be instinctive from the age of seven or eight onwards.
On the whole, human beings want to be good, but not too good, and not quite all the time.
One can love a child, perhaps, more deeply than one can love another adult, but it is rash to assume that the child feels any love in return.
One cannot really be a Catholic and grown up.
One of the effects of a safe and civilized life is an immense oversensitiveness which makes all the primary emotions somewhat disgusting. Generosity is as painful as meanness, gratitude as hateful as ingratitude.
Part of the reason for the ugliness of adults, in a child's eyes, is that the child is usually looking upwards, and few faces are at their best when seen from below.
Political speech and writing are largely the defense of the indefensible.
Power is not a means, it is an end. One does not establish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a revolution; one makes the revolution in order to establish the dictatorship.
Power-worship blurs political judgment because it leads, almost unavoidably, to the belief that present trends will continue. Whoever is winning at the moment will always seem to be invincible.
Probably the battle of Waterloo was won on the playing-fields of Eton, but the opening battles of all subsequent wars have been lost there.
Progress and reaction have both turned out to be swindles. Seemingly, there is nothing left but quietism - robbing reality of its terrors by simply submitting to it.
Progress is not an illusion, it happens, but it is slow and invariably disappointing.
Prolonged, indiscriminate reviewing of books is a quite exceptionally thankless, irritating and exhausting job. It not only involves praising trash but constantly inventing reactions towards books about which one has no spontaneous feeling whatever.
Saints should always be judged guilty until they are proved innocent.
Serious sport has nothing to do with fair play. It is bound up with hatred, jealousy, boastfulness, disregard of all rules and sadistic pleasure in witnessing violence. In other words, it is war minus the shooting.
So much of left-wing thought is a kind of playing with fire by people who don't even know that fire is hot.
Society has always seemed to demand a little more from human beings than it will get in practice.
The Catholic and the Communist are alike in assuming that an opponent cannot be both honest and intelligent.
The English are probably more capable than most peoples of making revolutionary change without bloodshed. In England, if anywhere, it would be possible to abolish poverty without destroying liberty.
The atmosphere of orthodoxy is always damaging to prose, and above all it is completely ruinous to the novel, the most anarchical of all forms of literature.
The atom bombs are piling up in the factories, the police are prowling through the cities, the lies are streaming from the loudspeakers, but the earth is still going round the sun.
The books one reads in childhood, and perhaps most of all the bad and good bad books, create in one's mind a sort of false map of the world, a series of fabulous countries into which one can retreat at odd moments throughout the rest of life, and which in some cases can survive a visit to the real countries which they are supposed to represent.
The child thinks of growing old as an almost obscene calamity, which for some mysterious reason will never happen to itself. All who have passed the age of thirty are joyless grotesques, endlessly fussing about things of no importance and staying alive without, so far as the child can see, having anything to live for. Only child life is real life.
The essence of being human is that one does not seek perfection, that one is sometimes willing to commit sins for the sake of loyalty, that one does not push asceticism to the point where it makes friendly intercourse impossible, and that one is prepared in the end to be defeated and broken up by life, which is the inevitable price of fastening one's love upon other human individuals.
The existence of good bad literature - the fact that one can be amused or excited or even moved by a book that one's intellect simply refuses to take seriously - is a reminder that art is not the same thing as cerebration.
The great disadvantage, and advantage, of the small urban bourgeois is his limited outlook. He sees the world as a middle-class world, and everything outside these limits is either laughable or slightly wicked.
The great enemy of clear language is insincerity. When there is a gap between one's real and one's declared aims, one turns as it were instinctively to long words and exhausted idioms, like a cuttlefish squirting out ink.
The high sentiments always win in the end, the leaders who offer blood, toil, tears and sweat always get more out of their followers than those who offer safety and a good time. When it comes to the pinch, human beings are heroic.
The intellectual is different from the ordinary man, but only in certain sections of his personality, and even then not all the time.
The main motive for "nonattachment" is a desire to escape from the pain of living, and above all from love, which, sexual or non-sexual, is hard work.
The moralist and the revolutionary are constantly undermining one another. Marx exploded a hundred tons of dynamite beneath the moralist position, and we are still living in the echo of that tremendous crash. But already, somewhere or other, the sappers are at work and fresh dynamite is being tamped in place to blow Marx at the moon. Then Marx, or somebody like him, will come back with yet more dynamite, and so the process continues, to an end we cannot foresee.
The "Communism" of the English intellectual is something explicable enough. It is the patriotism of the deracinated.
There is hardly such a thing as a war in which it makes no difference who wins. Nearly always one side stands more or less for progress, the other side more or less for reaction.
Throughout recorded time ... there have been three kinds of people in the world, the High, the Middle, and the Low. They have been subdivided in many ways, they have borne countless different names, and their relative numbers, as well as their attitude towards one another, have varied from age to age: but the essential structure of society has never altered. Even after enormous upheavals and seemingly irrevocable changes, the same pattern has always reasserted itself, just as a gyroscope will always return to equilibrium, however far it is pushed one way or the other. The aims of these three groups are entirely irreconcilable.
To a surprising extent the war-lords in shining armour, the apostles of the martial virtues, tend not to die fighting when the time comes. History is full of ignominious getaways by the great and famous.
To accept civilization as it is practically means accepting decay.
To an ordinary human being, love means nothing if it does not mean loving some people more than others.
To say "I accept" in an age like our own is to say that you accept concentration-camps, rubber truncheons, Hitler, Stalin, bombs, aeroplanes, tinned food, machine guns, putsches, purges, slogans, Bedaux belts, gas-masks, submarines, spies, provocateurs, press-censorship, secret prisons, aspirins, Hollywood films and political murder.
To survive it is often necessary to fight and to fight you have to dirty yourself.
To walk through the ruined cities of Germany is to feel an actual doubt about the continuity of civilization.
To write or even speak English is not a science but an art. There are no reliable words. ... Whoever writes English is involved in a struggle that never lets up even for a sentence. He is struggling against vagueness, against obscurity, against the lure of the decorative adjective, against the encroachment of Latin and Greek, and, above all, against the worn-out phrases and dead metaphors with which the language is cluttered up.
Under the spreading chestnut tree I sold you and you sold me: There lie they, and here lie we Under the spreading chestnut tree.
We of the sinking middle class ... may sink without further struggles into the working class where we belong, and probably when we get there it will not be so dreadful as we feared, for, after all, we have nothing to lose but our aitches.
What can you do against the lunatic who is more intelligent than yourself, who gives your arguments a fair hearing and then simply persists in his lunacy?
Who controls the past controls the future: who controls the present controls the past.
I have a quote for every event, except for this one.
I care not much for a man's religion whose dog and cat are not the better for it.
Nearly all men can stand adversity, but if you want to test a man's character, give him power.
A Government of the people, by the people and for the people, shall not perish from the earth.
A house divided against itself cannot stand - I believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free.
A jury too often has at least one member more ready to hang the panel than to hang the traitor.
A universal feeling, whether well or ill founded, cannot be safely disregarded.
A woman is the only thing I am afraid of that I know will not hurt me.
All my life I have tried to pluck a thistle and plant a flower wherever the flower would grow in thought and mind.
All that I am or hope to be, I owe to my angel mother.
Always bear in mind that your own resolution to succeed is more important than any other.
Am I not destroying my enemies when I make friends of them?
Among free men there can be no successful appeal from the ballot to the bullet.
And in the end, it's not the years in your life that count. It's the life in your years.
As I would not be a slave, so I would not be a master. This expresses my idea of democracy.
As our case is new, we must think and act anew.
Avoid popularity if you would have peace.
Ballots are the rightful and peaceful successors of bullets.
Be sure you put your feet in the right place, then stand firm.
Beware of rashness, but with energy, and sleepless vigilance, go forward and give us victories.
But in a larger sense we cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract.
Character is like a tree and reputation like its shadow. The shadow is what we think of it; the tree is the real thing.
Commitment is what transforms a promise into reality.
Common looking people are the best in the world: that is the reason the Lord makes so many of them.
Determine that the thing can and shall be done, and then we shall find the way.
Do not destroy that immortal emblem of humanity, the Declaration of Independence.
Do not worry; eat three square meals a day; say your prayers; be courteous to your creditors; keep your digestion good; exercise; go slow and easy. Maybe there are other things your special case requires to make you happy; but, my friend, these I reckon will give you a good lift.
Don't worry when you are not recognized, but strive to be worthy of recognition.
Every man is said to have his peculiar ambition.
Every man over forty is responsible for his face.
Everybody likes a compliment.
Fellow citizens, we cannot escape history.
Few can be induced to labor exclusively for posterity; and none will do it enthusiastically. Posterity has done nothing for us; and theorize on it as we may, practically we shall do very little for it, unless we are made to think we are at the same time doing something for ourselves.
Force is all-conquering, but its victories are short-lived.
Fourscore and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. We here highly resolve that the dead shall not have died in vain, that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom; and that government of the people, by the people, and for the people, shall not perish from the earth.
Freedom is not the right to do what we want, but what we ought. Let us have faith that right makes might and in that faith let us; to the end, dare to do our duty as we understand it.
Freedom is the last, best hope of earth.
Friends, I agree with you in Providence; but I believe in the Providence of the most men, the largest purse, and the longest cannon.
God must love the common man, he made so many of them.
Having thus chosen our course, without guile and with pure purpose, let us renew our trust in God, and go forward without fear and with manly hearts.
He reminds me of the man who murdered both his parents, and then when the sentence was about to be pronounced, pleaded for mercy on the grounds that he was orphan.
He who molds the public sentiment ... makes statues and decisions possible or impossible to make.
Hold on with a bulldog grip, and chew and choke as much as possible.
Honest statesmanship is the wise employment of individual meanness for the public good.
How many legs does a dog have if you call the tail a leg? Four. Calling a tail a leg doesn't make it a leg.
I am not bound to win, but I am bound to be true. I am not bound to succeed but I am bound to live the best life that I have. I must stand with anybody that stands right and part from him when he goes wrong.
I am not concerned that you have fallen - I am concerned that you arise.
I believe, if we take habitual drunkards as a class, their heads and their hearts will bear an advantageous comparison with those of any other class. There seems ever to have been a proneness in the brilliant and warm-blooded to fall into this vice.
I bring to this great work a heart filled with love for my country and an honest desire to do what is right.
I can make a General in five minutes but a good horse is hard to replace.
I claim not to have controlled events, but confess plainly that events have controlled me.
I desire to so conduct the affairs of this administration that if at the end, when I come to lay down the reins of power, I have lost every other friend on earth, I shall at least have one friend left, and that friend shall be down inside of me.
I do the very best I know how - the very best I can; and I mean to keep on doing so until the end.
I don't know who my grandfather was; I am much more concerned to know what his grandson will be.
I don't think much of a man who is not wiser today than he was yesterday.
I dream of a place and a time where America will once again be seen as the last best hope on earth.
I fear explanations explanatory of things explained.
I have been driven many times to my knees by the overwhelming conviction that I had nowhere to go. My own wisdom, and that of all about me, seemed insufficient for the day.
I have come to the conclusion never again to think of marrying, and for this reason, I can never be satisfied with anyone who would be blockhead enough to have me.
I laugh because I must not cry. That is all. That is all.
I never had a policy; I have just tried to do my very best each and every day.
I see in the near future a crisis approaching that unnerves me and causes me to tremble for the safety of my country. Corporations have been enthroned, an era of corruption in high places will follow, and the money-power of the country will endeavor to prolong it's reign by working upon the prejudices of the people until the wealth is aggregated in a few hands and the Republic is destroyed.
I shall do more whenever I shall believe doing more will help the cause.
I shall try to correct errors when shown to be errors, and I shall adopt new views so fast as they shall appear to be new views.
I sincerely wish war was a pleasanter and easier business than it is, but it does not admit of holidays.
I walk slowly, but I never walk backward.

It has been my experience that folks who have no vices have very few virtues.
It is the eternal struggle between these two principles - right and wrong. They are the two principles that have stood face to face from the beginning of time and will ever continue to struggle. It is the same spirit that says, "You work and toil and earn bread, and I'll eat it."
Labor is prior to, and independent of, capital. Capital is only the fruit of labor, and could never have existed if labor had not first existed.

Prohibition goes beyond the bounds of reason in that it attempts to control a man's appetite by legislation and makes crimes out of things that are not crimes.
Prohibition will work great injury to the cause of temperance. It is a species of intemperance within itself, for it goes beyond the bounds of reason in that it attempts to control a man's appetite by legislation, and makes a crime out of things that are not crimes. A Prohibition law strikes a blow at the very principles upon which our government was founded.
Property is the fruit of labor; property is desirable; it is a positive good in the world.
Public sentiment is everything, without it nothing can fail, without it nothing can succeed.
Quarrel not at all. No man resolved to make the most of himself can spare time for personal contention. Still less can he afford to take all the consequences, including the vitiating of his temper and loss of self control. Yield larger things to which you can show no more than equal right; and yield lesser ones, though clearly your own. Better give your path to a dog than be bitten by him in contesting for the right. Even killing the dog would not cure the bite.
Seriously, I do not think I am fit for the presidency.

We live in the midst of alarms; anxiety beclouds the future; we expect some new disaster with each newspaper we read.
We must ask where we are and whither we are tending.
We must not be enemies. Though passion may have strained, it must not break our bonds of affection. The mystic chords of memory, stretching from every battlefield and patriot grave, to every living heart and hearth-stone, all over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature.
We must not promise what we ought not, lest we be called on to perform what we cannot.

It is not death that a man should fear, but he should fear never beginning to live.
It is not the weight of the future or the past that is pressing upon you, but ever that of the present alone. Even this burden, too, can be lessened if you confine it strictly to its own limits.
Let it be your constant method to look into the design of people's actions, and see what they would be at, as often as it is practicable; and to make this custom the more significant, practice it first upon yourself.

Let not your mind run on what you lack as much as on what you have already.
Life is neither good or evil, but only a place for good and evil.

Our life depends on what our thoughts make it.
Reject your sense of injury and the injury itself disappears.
Remember how often you have postponed minding your interest, and let slip those opportunities the gods have given you. It is now high time to consider what sort of world you are part of, and from what kind of governor of it you are descended; that you have a set period assigned you to act in, and unless you improve it to brighten and compose your thoughts, it will quickly run off with you, and be lost beyond recovery.

If we could all live solitary and without labor, we could all enjoy this ecstasy of independence; since we cannot, its delights are only available to madmen and dictators
In all affairs it's a healthy thing now and then to hang a question mark on the things you have long taken for granted.
No great achievement is possible without persistent work.
It [the world] must be a world in which affection has free play, in which love is purged of the instinct for domination, in which cruelty and envy have been dispelled by happiness and the unfettered development of all the instincts that build up life and fill it with mental delights. Such a world is possible; it waits only for men to wish to create it.
Three passions, simple but overwhelmingly strong, have governed my life: the longing for love, the search for knowledge, and unbearable pity for the suffering of mankind.
The point of philosophy is to start with something so simple as not to seem worth stating, and to end with something so paradoxical that no one will believe it.
The thing that I should wish to obtain from money would be leisure with security.
Much that passes as idealism is disguised hatred or disguised love of power.
To fear love is to fear life, and those who fear life are already three parts dead.
To conquer fear is the beginning of wisdom.
Religion is something left over from the infancy of our intelligence, it will fade away as we adopt reason and science as our guidelines.
Freedom in general may be defined as the absence of obstacles to the realization of desires
Love is something far more than desire for sexual intercourse; it is the principal means of escape from the loneliness which afflicts most men and women throughout the greater part of their lives.
Neither a man nor a crowd nor a nation can be trusted to act humanely or to think sanely under the influence of a great fear.
There is something feeble and a little contemptible about a man who cannot face the perils of life without the help of comfortable myths
Life is nothing but a competition to be the criminal rather than the victim.
If everything must have a cause, then God must have a cause. If there can be anything without a cause, it may just as well be the world as God, so that there cannot be any validity in that argument
Anything you're good at contributes to happiness
Religions, which condemn the pleasures of sense, drive men to seek the pleasures of power. Throughout history power has been the vice of the ascetic.
Many a man will have the courage to die gallantly, but will not have the courage to say, or even to think, that the cause for which he is asked to die is an unworthy one
To be without some of the things you want is an indispensable part of happiness.
The time you enjoy wasting is not wasted time.
Most people would sooner die than think; in fact, they do so.
It is possible that mankind is on the threshold of a golden age; but, if so, it will be necessary first to slay the dragon that guards the door, and this dragon is religion
The demand for certainty is one which is natural to man, but is nevertheless an intellectual vice
I would never die for my beliefs because I might be wrong.
Collective fear stimulates herd instinct, and tends to produce ferocity toward those who are not regarded as members of the herd.
A hallucination is a fact, not an error; what is erroneous is a judgment based upon it.
The secret to happiness is to face the fact that the world is horrible
A happy life must be to a great extent a quiet life, for it is only in an atmosphere of quiet that true joy dare live
The only thing that will redeem mankind is cooperation.
Contempt for happiness is usually contempt for other people's happiness, and is an elegant disguise for hatred of the human race
What is wanted is not the will to believe, but the wish to find out, which is its exact opposite
The most savage controversies are about matters as to which there is no good evidence either way
The infliction of cruelty with a good conscience is a delight to moralists. That is why they invented Hell.
There will still be things that machines cannot do. They will not produce great art or great literature or great philosophy; they will not be able to discover the secret springs of happiness in the human heart; they will know nothing of love and friendship.
One should respect public opinion insofar as is necessary to avoid starvation and keep out of prison, but anything that goes beyond this is voluntary submission to an unnecessary tyranny.
Most people would rather die than think: many do.
Civilized people cannot fully satisfy their sexual instinct without love
The wise man thinks about his troubles only when there is some purpose in doing so; at other times he thinks about other things
Why is propaganda so much more successful when it stirs up hatred than when it tries to stir up friendly feeling?
Sin is geographical.
The most valuable things in life are not measured in monetary terms. The really important things are not houses and lands, stocks and bonds, automobiles and real state, but friendships, trust, confidence, empathy, mercy, love and faith.
This has been my life. I have found it worth living, and would gladly live it again if the chance were offered me.
What men want is not knowledge, but certainty.
All exact science is dominated by the idea of approximation.
When one admits that nothing is certain one must, I think, also add that some things are more nearly certain than others
The fact that an opinion has been widely held is no evidence whatever that it is not utterly absurd.
There is much pleasure to be gained from useless knowledge.
I've made an odd discovery. Every time I talk to a savant I feel quite sure that happiness is no longer a possibility. Yet when I talk with my gardener, I'm convinced of the opposite.
The true spirit of delight, the exaltation, the sense of being more than Man, which is the touchstone of the highest excellence, is to be found in mathematics as surely as in poetry
God is a reality of spirit... He cannot... be conceived as an object, not even as the very highest object. God is not to be found in the world of objects.
More important than the curriculum is the question of the methods of teaching and the spirit in which the teaching is given
To be able to fill leisure intelligently is the last product of civilization, and at present very few people have reached this level.
If you wish to be happy yourself, you must resign yourself to seeing others also happy
I believe in using words, not fists... I believe in my outrage knowing people are living in boxes on the street. I believe in honesty. I believe in a good time. I believe in good food. I believe in sex.
The essence of the Liberal outlook lies not in what opinions are held, but in how they are held: instead of being held dogmatically, they are held tentatively, and with a consciousness that new evidence may at any moment lead to their abandonment.
Thinking you know when in fact you don't is a fatal mistake, to which we are all prone
It's a waste of energy to be angry with a man who behaves badly, just as it is to be angry with a car that won't go
I say quite deliberately that the Christian religion, as organized in its churches, has been and still is the principal enemy of moral progress in the world
What hunger is in relation to food, zest is in relation to life
Happiness is not best achieved by those who seek it directly
It has been said that man is a rational animal. All my life I have been searching for evidence which could support this.
I had supposed until that time that it was quite common for parents to love their children, but the war persuaded me that it is a rare exception. I had supposed that most people liked money better than almost anything else, but I discovered that they liked destruction even better. I had supposed that intellectuals frequently loved truth, but I found here again that not ten percent of them prefer truth to popularity.
Science can teach us, and I think our own hearts can teach us, no longer to look around for imaginary supports, no longer to invent allies in the sky, but rather to look to our own efforts here below to make this world a fit place to live in, instead
The degree of one's emotions varies inversely with one's knowledge of the facts.
Men who are unhappy, like men who sleep badly, are always proud of the fact
The teacher, like the artist and the philosopher, can perform his work adequately only if he feels himself to be an individual directed by an inner creative impulse, not dominated and fettered by an outside authority.
Science may set limits to knowledge, but should not set limits to imagination.
My first advice on how not to grow old would be to choose you ancestors carefully.
The observer, when he seems to himself to be observing a stone, is really, if physics is to be believed, observing the effects of the stone upon himself.
To be happy in this world, especially when youth is past, it is necessary to feel oneself not merely an isolated individual whose day will soon be over, but part of the stream of life flowing on from the first germ to the remote and unknown future.
Three passions, simple but overwhelmingly strong, have governed my life: the longing for love, the search for knowledge, and unbearable pity for the suffering of mankind.
Italy, and the spring and first love all together should suffice to make the gloomiest person happy.
If we were all given by magic power to read each other's thoughts, I suppose the first effect would be to dissolve all friendships
The greatest challenge to any thinker is stating the problem in a way that will allow a solution
You must not kill your neighbor, whom perhaps you genuinely hate, but by a little propaganda this hate can be transferred to some foreign nation, against whom all your murderous impulses become patriotic heroism
Right discipline consists, not in external compulsion, but in the habits of mind which lead spontaneously to desirable rather than undesirable activities.
It is illegal in England to state in print that a wife can and should derive sexual pleasure from intercourse
What a man believes upon grossly insufficient evidence is an index into his desires -- desires of which he himself is often unconscious. If a man is offered a fact which goes against his instincts, he will scrutinize it closely, and unless the evidence is overwhelming, he will refuse to believe it. If, on the other hand, he is offered something which affords a reason for acting in accordance to his instincts, he will accept it even on the slightest evidence. The origin of myths is explained in this way.
Life is a brief, small, and transitory phenomenon in an obscure corner, not at all the sort of thing that one would make a fuss about if one were not personally concerned
None but a coward dares to boast that he has never known fear.
Every advance in civilization has been denounced as unnatural while it was recent
Patriots always talk of dying for their country, and never of killing for their country.
Patriotism is the willingness to kill and be killed for trivial reasons.
There is no nonsense so arrant that it cannot be made the creed of the vast majority by adequate governmental action
No one gossips about other people's secret virtues.
We have, in fact, two kinds of morality side by side; one which we preach but do not practice, and another which we practice but seldom preach.
Democracy is the process by which people choose the man who'll get the blame.
To teach how to live without certainty, and yet without, being paralyzed by hesitation, is perhaps the chief thing that philosophy in our age can do for those who study it
All who are not lunatics are agreed about certain things : That it is better to be alive than dead, better to be adequately fed than starved, better to be free than a slave
Machines are worshipped because they are beautiful, and valued because they confer power; they are hated because they are hideous, and loathed because they impose slavery
By self-interest, Man has become gregarious, but in instinct he has remained to a great extent solitary; hence the need of religion and morality to reinforce self-interest
The most savage controversies are those about matters as to which there is no good evidence either way. Persecution is used in theology, not in arithmetic.
Advocates of capitalism are very apt to appeal to the sacred principles of liberty, which are embodied in one maxim: The fortunate must not be restrained in the exercise of tyranny over the unfortunate
A life without adventure is likely to be unsatisfying, but a life in which adventure is allowed to take whatever form it will is sure to be short.
The secret of happiness is this: let your interests be as wide as possible, and let your reactions to the things and persons that interest you be as far as possible friendly rather than hostile.
Ethics is in origin the art of recommending to others the sacrifices required for cooperation with oneself.
Unless a man has been taught what to do with success after getting it, the achievement of it must inevitably leave him a prey to boredom.
The three main extra-rational activities in modern life are religion, war, and love; all these are extra-rational, but love is not anti-rational, that is to say, a reasonable man may reasonably rejoice in its existence
Mathematics is the only science where one never knows what one is talking about nor whether what is said is true
By religion I mean a set of beliefs held as dogmas, dominating the conduct of life, going beyond or contrary to evidence, and inculcated by methods which are emotional or authoritarian, not intellectual
Mathematics, rightly viewed, posses not only truth, but supreme beauty; a beauty cold and austere, like that of sculpture
Every man, wherever he goes, is encompassed by a cloud of comforting convictions which move with him like flies on a summer day
Few people can be happy unless they hate some other person, nation, or creed
I do not pretend that birth control is the only way in which population can be kept from increasing. There are others, which, one must suppose, opponents of birth control would prefer.
Law in origin was merely a codification of the power of dominant groups, and did not aim at anything that to a modern man would appear to be justice
I like mathematics because it is not human and has nothing particular to do with this planet or with the whole accidental universe - because, like Spinoza's God, it won't love us in return.
Human life, its growth, its hopes, fears, loves, et cetera, are the result of accidents
I am not myself in any degree ashamed of having changed my opinions
Even when the experts all agree, they may well be mistaken.
Throughout the long period of religious doubt, I had been rendered very unhappy by the gradual loss of belief, but when the process was completed, I found to my surprise that I was quite glad to be done with the whole subject
The qualities most needed are charity and tolerance, not some form of fanatical faith such as is offered to us by the various rampant isms
In order to be happy we require all kinds of supports to our self-esteem. We are human beings, therefore human beings are the purpose of god's creation
There's a Bible on the shelf there. But I keep it next to Voltaire-poison and antidote.
Aristotle maintained that women have fewer teeth than men; although he was twice married, it never occurred to him to verify this statement by examining his wives' mouths.
For my part I distrust all generalizations about women, favorable and unfavorable, masculine and feminine, ancient and modern; all alike, I should say, result from paucity of experience.
Most political leaders acquire their position by causing large numbers of people to believe that these leaders are actuated by altruistic desires
Drunkenness is temporary suicide: the happiness that it brings is merely negative, a momentary cessation of unhappiness
I've always thought respectable people scoundrels, and I look anxiously at my face every morning for signs of my becoming a scoundrel.
We must care about the world of our children and grandchildren, a world we may never see.
A sense of duty is useful in work but offensive in personal relations. People wish to be liked, not to be endured with patient resignation.
A truer image of the world, I think, is obtained by picturing things as entering into the stream of time from an eternal world outside, than from a view which regards time as the devouring tyrant of all that is.
Both in thought and in feeling, even though time be real, to realize the unimportance of time is the gate of wisdom.
Love should be a tree whose roots are deep in the earth, but whose branches extend into heaven.
A process which led from the amoebae to man appeared to the philosophers to be obviously a progress - though whether the amoebae would agree with this opinion is not known.
Against my will, in the course of my travels, the belief that everything worth knowing was known at Cambridge gradually wore off. In this respect my travels were very useful to me.
Doing linear scans over an associative array is like trying to club someone to death with a loaded Uzi
For me, writing is a love-hate relationship.
Hubris itself will not let you be an artist.
I am not a sort of person who wants to run a company.
I still drive my 1977 Honda Accord. The paint is almost all worn off. It's still running.
I take time to watch anime. I don't know whether I'm allowed to, but I do it anyway.
I talked about becoming stupid, but I've always been stupid. Fortunately I've been just smart enough to realize that I'm stupid.
I think computer science, by and large, is still stuck in the Modern age.
I think operating systems work best if they're free and open. Particular applications are more likely to be proprietary.
I think software patents are a bad idea. Many patents are given for trivial inventions.
I think the way IBM has embraced the open source philosophy has been quite astonishing, but gratifying. I hope they'll do very well with it.
I want people to use Perl. I want to be a positive ingredient of the world and make my American history. So, whatever it takes to give away my software and get it used, that's great.
I'm just paid to do whatever I want to do. Some of the time it's development, and some of the time it's just goofing off.
I'm never satisfied because I've been always interested in too many things and I always want to do everything at once.
If any ideology is so serious that you can't have fun while you're doing it, it's probably too serious.
If you're a large corporation, you can afford to pay the money to register patents, but if you're an individual like me, you can't.
Many days I don't write any code at all, and some days I spend all day writing code.
One of the very basic ideas of Post-Modernism is rejection of arbitrary power structures. Different people are sensitive to different kinds of power structures.
Perl was designed to work more like a natural language. It's a little more complicated but there are more shortcuts, and once you learned the language, it's more expressive.
Post-Modernism was a reaction against Modernism. It came quite early to music and literature, and a little later to architecture. And I think it's still coming to computer science.
Programmers can be lazy.
Some of modern engineering is necessary to good art. But I think of myself is a cultural artist.
Somebody out there is going to do something that's far more surprising than anything that I would do. I was surprised by the whole web thing in the first place.
The Harvard Law states: Under controlled conditions of light, temperature, humidity, and nutrition, the organism will do as it damn well pleases.
The problems that I really like to solve are our cultural problems.
The three chief virtues of a programmer are: Laziness, Impatience and Hubris.
The world has become a larger place. The universe has been expanding, and Perl's been expanding along with the universe.
There is no schedule. We are all volunteers, so we get it done when we get it done. Perl 5 still works fine, and we plan to take the right amount of time on Perl 6.
To be a good artist, you have to serve the work of art and allow it to be what it is supposed to be.
We all agree on the necessity of compromise. We just can't agree on when it's necessary to compromise.
We are so Post-Modern that we don't realize how Post-Modern we are anymore.
When I announced the development of Perl 6, I said it was going to be a community design. I designed Perl, myself. It's limited by my own brain power. So I wanted Perl 6 to be a community design.
Younger hackers are hard to classify. They're probably just as diverse as the old hackers are. We're all over the map.
He who lives by the sword, die by the sword
Next to being married, a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and then.
Pretend inferiority and encourage his arrogance.
Regard your soldiers as your children, and they will follow you into the deepest valleys; look on them as your own beloved sons, and they will stand by you even unto death.
Opportunities multiply as they are seized.
Supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy's resistance without fighting.
War is based on deception.
The art of war teaches us to rely not on the likelihood of the enemy's not coming, but on our own readiness to receive him; not on the chance of his not attacking, but rather on the fact that we have made our position unassailable.
Strategy without tactics is the slowest route to victory. Tactics without strategy is the noise before defeat.
You have to believe in yourself.
Let your plans be dark and as impenetrable as night, and when you move, fall like a thunderbolt.
Victorious warriors win first and then go to war, while defeated warriors go to war first and then seek to win.
If you know the enemy and know yourself you need not fear the results of a hundred battles.
Can you imagine what I would do if I could do all I can?
Know thy self, know thy enemy. A thousand battles, a thousand victories.
Be extremely subtle, even to the point of formlessness. Be extremely mysterious, even to the point of soundlessness. Thereby you can be the director of the opponent's fate.
Invincibility lies in the defence; the possibility of victory in the Attack.
Prohibit the taking of omens, and do away with superstitious doubts. Then, until death itself comes, no calamity need be feared.
If you are far from the enemy, make him believe you are near.
The good fighters of old first put themselves beyond the possibility of defeat, and then waited for an opportunity of defeating the enemy.
Thus, what is of supreme importance in war is to attack the enemy's strategy.
For to win one hundred victories in one hundred battles is not the acme of skill. To subdue the enemy without fighting is the acme of skill.
There has never been a protracted war from which a country has benefited.
All warfare is based on deception. Hence, when able to attack, we must seem unable; when using our forces, we must seem inactive; when we are near, we must make the enemy believe we are far away; when far away, we must make him believe we are near.
All war is deception.
The one who figures on victory at headquarters before even doing battle is the one who has the most strategic factors on his side.
If you know the enemy and know yourself, your victory will not stand in doubt; if you know Heaven and know Earth, you may make your victory complete.
The opportunity to secure ourselves against defeat lies in our own hands, but the opportunity of defeating the enemy is provided by the enemy himself.
He who knows when he can fight and when he cannot, will be victorious.
For them to perceive the advantage of defeating the enemy, they must also have their rewards.
Confront them with annihilation, and they will then survive; plunge them into a deadly situation, and they will then live. When people fall into danger, they are then able to strive for victory.
He who is prudent and lies in wait for an enemy who is not, will be victorious.
If ignorant both of your enemy and yourself, you are certain to be in peril.
All men can see these tactics whereby I conquer, but what none can see is the strategy out of which victory is evolved.
The skilful employer of men will employ the wise man, the brave man, the covetous man, and the stupid man.
In the practical art of war, the best thing of all is to take the enemy's country whole and intact; to shatter and destroy it is not so good.
There is no instance of a nation benefiting from prolonged warfare.
Thus it is that in war the victorious strategist only seeks battle after the victory has been won, whereas he who is destined to defeat first fights and afterwards looks for victory.
The enlightened ruler is heedful, and the good general full of caution.
Secret operations are essential in war; upon them the army relies to make its every move.
Hence that general is skilful in attack whose opponent does not know what to defend; and he is skilful in defense whose opponent does not know what to attack.
The general who wins the battle makes many calculations in his temple before the battle is fought. The general who loses makes but few calculations beforehand.
Do not press an enemy at bay.
The skillful leader subdues the enemy's troops without any fighting; he captures their cities without laying siege to them; he overthrows their kingdom without lengthy operations in the field. With his forces intact he disputes the mastery of the emp
A kingdom that has once been destroyed can never come again into being; nor can the dead ever be brought back to life.
A wise general makes a point of foraging of the enemy.
When envoys are sent with compliments in their mouths, it is a sign that the enemy wishes for a truce.
The art of giving orders is not to try to rectify the minor blunders and not to be swayed by petty doubts.
So there are five ways of knowing who will win. Those who know when to fight and when not to fight are victorious. Those who discern when to use many or few troops are victorious. Those whose upper and lower ranks have the same desire are victorious.
It is essential to seek out enemy agents who have come to conduct espionage against you and to bribe them to serve you. Give them instructions and care for them. Thus doubled agents are recruited and used.
defeat the enemies strategy
The quality of decision is like the well-timed swoop of a falcon which enables it to strike and destroy its victim.
O divine art of subtlety and secrecy! Through you we learn to be invisible, through you inaudible and hence we can hold the enemy's fate in our hands.
There are not more than five musical notes, yet the combinations of these five give rise to more melodies than can ever be heard.
Now the reason the enlightened prince and the wise general conquer the enemy whenever they move and their achievements surpass those of ordinary men is foreknowledge.
If our soldiers are not overburdened with money, it is not because they have a distaste for riches; if their lives are not unduly long, it is not because they are disinclined to longevity.
The general who advances without coveting fame and retreats without fearing disgrace, whose only thought is to protect his country and do good service for his sovereign, is the jewel of the kingdom.
The ultimate in disposing one's troops is to be without ascertainable shape. Then the most penetrating spies cannot pry in nor can the wise lay plans against you.
So the important thing in a military operation is victory, not persistence.
To perceive victory when it is known to all is not really skilful. Everyone calls victory in battle good, but it is not really good.
In peace prepare for war, in war prepare for peace. The art of war is of vital importance to the state. It is matter of life and death, a road either to safety or to ruin. Hence under no circumstances can it be neglected.
It is imperative to contest all factions for complete victory, so the army is not garrisoned and the profit can be total. This is the law of strategic siege.
The best victory is when the opponent surrenders of its own accord before there are any actual hostilities...It is best to win without fighting.
Therefore a victorious army first wins and then seeks battle; a defeated army first battles and then seeks victory.
According to my assessment, even if you have many more troops than others, how can that help you to victory?
Of all those in the army close to the commander none is more intimate than the secret agent; of all rewards none more liberal than those given to secret agents; of all matters none is more confidential than those relating to secret operations.
If fighting is sure to result in victory, then you must fight, even though the ruler forbid it; if fighting will not result is victory, then you must not fight, even at the ruler's bidding.
The proximity of an army causes prices to go up; and high prices cause people's substance to be drained away. When their substance is drained away, they will be afflicted by heavy exactions. With this loss of substance and exhaustion of strength, the homes of the people will be stripped bare, and their incomes dissipated.
One who sets the entire army in motion to chase an advantage will not attain it.
Unhappy is the fate of one who tries to win his battles and succeed in his attacks without cultivating the spirit of enterprise, for the result is waste of time and general stagnation.
The clever combatant imposes his will on the enemy, but does not allow the enemy's will to be imposed on him.
I know why it has the name "C" and "C++" for the languages: It's the grade of the language...
Tardiness often robs us opportunity, and the dispatch of our forces.
There is nothing more difficult to take in hand, more perilous to conduct or more uncertain in its success than to take the lead in the introduction of a new order of things.
Hatred is gained as much by good works as by evil.
Before all else, be armed.
The more sand that has escaped from the hourglass of our life, the clearer we should see through it.
There are three kinds of intelligence: one kind understands things for itself, the other appreciates what others can understand, the third understands neither for itself nor through others. This first kind is excellent, the second good, and the third kind useless.
Whosoever desires constant success must change his conduct with the times.
Men shrink less from offending one who inspires love than one who inspires fear.
He who wishes to be obeyed must know how to command.
There is no surer sign of decay in a country than to see the rites of religion held in contempt
So long as the great majority of men are not deprived of either property or honor, they are satisfied
And here comes in the question whether it is better to be loved rather than feared, or feared rather than loved. It might perhaps be answered that we should wish to be both; but since love and fear can hardly exist together, if we must choose between them, it is far safer to be feared than loved....I sum up by saying that since his being loved depends upon his subjects, while his being feared depends upon himself, [one] should build on what is his own, and not on what rests with others.
Men in general judge more from appearances than from reality. All men have eyes, but few have the gift of penetration
For as laws are necessary that good manners be preserved, so there is need of good manners that law may be maintained
War is just when it is necessary; arms are permissible when there is no hope except in arms.
Entrepreneurs are simply those who understand that there is little difference between obstacle and opportunity and are able to turn both to their advantage.
It is better to be feared than loved, if you cannot be both.
Men in general judge more by the sense of sight than by the sense of touch, because everyone can see, but only a few can test by feeling. Everyone sees what you seem to be, few know what you really are, and those few do not dare take a stand against the general opinion.
Of mankind we may say in general they are fickle, hypocritical, and greedy of gain.
There is no avoiding war; it can only be postponed to the advantage of others.
One who deceives will always find those who allow themselves to be deceived.
The promise given was a necessity of the past: the word broken is a necessity of the present.
God is not willing to do everything, and thus take away our free will and that share of glory which belongs to us
I'm not interested in preserving the status quo; I want to overthrow it.
Never was anything great achieved without danger
Politics have no relation to morals.
There is nothing more difficult to carry out, nor more doubtful of success, nor more dangerous to handle, that to institute a new order of things
Men are so simple and so much inclined to obey immediate needs that a deceiver will never lack victims for his deceptions
If an injury has to be done to a man it should be so severe that his vengeance need not be feared
A prince must imitate the fox and the lion, for the lion cannot protect himself from traps, and the fox cannot defend himself from wolves. One must therefore be a fox to recognize traps, and a lion to frighten wolves. Those that wish to be only lions do not understand this. Therefore, a prudent ruler ought not to keep faith when by so doing it would be against his interest, and when the reasons which made him bind himself no longer exist. If men were all good, this precept would not be a good one; but as they are bad, and would not observe their faith with you, so you are not bound to keep faith with them.
It is not titles that honor men, but men that honor titles.
The question is, then, do we try to make things easy on ourselves or do we try to make things easy on our customers, whoever they may be?
And if, to be sure, sometimes you need to conceal a fact with words, do it in such a way that it does not become known, or, if it does become known, that you have a ready and quick defense
Where the willingness is great the difficulties cannot be great
The new ruler must determine all the injuries that he will need to inflict. He must inflict them once and for all.
A wise ruler ought never to keep faith when by doing so it would be against his interests.
Men should be either treated generously or destroyed, because they take revenge for slight injuries - for heavy ones they cannot
Princes and governments are far more dangerous than other elements within society.
No enterprise is more likely to succeed than one concealed from the enemy until it is ripe for execution.
It is necessary for him who lays out a state and arranges laws for it to presuppose that all men are evil and that they are always going to act according to the wickedness of their spirits whenever they have free scope
Hence it comes about that all armed prophets have been victorious, and all unarmed prophets have been destroyed.
The wish to acquire more is admittedly a very natural and common thing; and when men succeed in this they are always praised rather than condemned. But when they lack the ability to do so and yet want to acquire more at all costs, they deserve condemnation for their mistakes.
Benefits should be conferred gradually; and in that way they will taste better
Men are more apt to be mistaken in their generalizations than in their particular observations.
Men rise from one ambition to another: first, they seek to secure themselves against attack, and then they attack others.
The one who adapts his policy to the times prospers, and likewise that the one whose policy clashes with the demands of the times does not.
Severities should be dealt out all at once, so that their suddenness may give less offense; benefits ought to be handed ought drop by drop, so that they may be relished the more.
We cannot attribute to fortune or virtue that which is achieved without either.
War should be the only study of a prince. He should consider peace only as a breathing-time, which gives him leisure to contrive, and furnishes as ability to execute, military plans.
The fact is that a man who wants to act virtuously in every way necessarily comes to grief among so many who are not virtuous.
A return to first principles in a republic is sometimes caused by the simple virtues of one man. His good example has such an influence that the good men strive to imitate him, and the wicked are ashamed to lead a life so contrary to his example.
A prince never lacks legitimate reasons to break his promise
It is better to be bold than too circumspect, because fortune is of a sex which likes not a tardy wooer and repulses all who are not ardent
Men sooner forget the death of their father than the loss of their patrimony.
A wise man will see to it that his acts always seem voluntary and not done by compulsion, however much he may be compelled by necessity.
There is no other way for securing yourself against flatteries except that men understand that they do not offend you by telling you the truth; but when everybody can tell you the truth, you fail to get respect
Men nearly always follow the tracks made by others and proceed in their affairs by imitation, even though they cannot entirely keep to the tracks of others or emulate the prowess of their models. So a prudent man should always follow in the footsteps of great men and imitate those who have been outstanding. If his own prowess fails to compare with theirs, at least it has an air of greatness about it. He should behave like those archers who, if they are skilful, when the target seems too distant, know the capabilities of their bow and aim a good deal higher than their objective, not in order to shoot so high but so that by aiming high they can reach the target.
For the great majority of mankind are satisfied with appearance, as though they were realities and are often more influenced by the things that seem than by those that are
According to Jim the sequence of Blob creation is as follows: 1. Barry Robinson, my boss at DEC, was prone to wandering around muttering "blobs, blobs, we gotta have blobs." When I asked what a blob was, he pointed out that I was the architect and that was my job.
According to Jim the sequence of Blob creation is as follows: 4. The retired bouncer hired to head the DSRI process rules that blobs were in, but had to be renamed "segmented strings" to avoid offending Clevelandites (or whatever).
According to Jim the sequence of Blob creation is as follows: 5. Much later, Terry McKiever, an Apollo marketing gnome, fell in love with the concept of blob, but felt the blob needed to be an acronym. She started calling them "basic large objects." Apollo never private labelled the product, so this should be irrelevant. Unfortunately, her ravings got the attention of Informix (I think) who announced that they would support "binary large objects" at some future time. The damage was done.
Do not spoil what you have by desiring what you have not; remember that what you now have was once among the things you only hoped for.
Living with integrity means: Not settling for less than what you know you deserve in your relationships. Asking for what you want and need from others. Speaking your truth, even though it might create conflict or tension. Behaving in ways that are in harmony with your personal values. Making choices based on what you believe, and not what others believe.
If ever there is tomorrow when we're not together.. there is something you must always remember. you are braver than you believe, stronger than you seem, and smarter than you think. but the most important thing is, even if we're apart.. i'll always be with you.
The folks you help won't remember it and the folks you hurt won't ever forget it.
When we're incomplete, we're always searching for somebody to complete us. When, after a few years or a few months of a relationship, we find that we're still unfulfilled, we blame our partners and take up with somebody more promising. This can go on and on--series polygamy--until we admit that while a partner can add sweet dimensions to our lives, we, each of us, are responsible for our own fulfillment. Nobody else can provide it for us, and to believe otherwise is to delude ourselves dangerously and to program for eventual failure every relationship we enter.
Put your hand on a hot stove for a minute, and it seems like an hour. Sit with a pretty girl for an hour, and it seems like a minute. THAT'S relativity.
We used to think that if we knew one, we knew two, because one and one are two. We are finding that we must learn a great deal more about 'and.'
Love me when I least deserve it, because that's when I really need it.
As pascal shows, something proven is often better as some hype ;)
With risk there may be change; with change there must always be risk.
You yourself, as much as anybody in the entire universe, deserve your love and affection.
Your task is not to seek for love, but merely to seek and find all the barriers within yourself that you have built against it.
Trust yourself. You know more than you think you do.
Courage consists in the power of self-recovery.
You cannot control what happens to you, but you can control your attitude toward what happens to you, and in that, you will be mastering change rather than allowing it to master you.
Only the shallow know themselves.
I don't at all like knowing what people say of me behind my back. It makes me far too conceited.
You never find yourself until you face the truth
If you think nobody cares if you're alive, try missing a couple of car payments.
You cannot hate other people without hating your self
Write to be understood, speak to be heard, read to grow...
I went to a bookstore and asked the saleswoman, "Where's the self-help section?" She said if she told me, it would defeat the purpose
Any fool can criticize, condemn, and complain but it takes character and self control to be understanding and forgiving.
With self-discipline most anything is possible.
Self-worth comes from one thing -- thinking that you are worthy.
All of the significant battles are waged within the self
Good government is no substitute for self-government
I am, indeed, a king, because I know how to rule myself.
The surest aid in combating the male's disease of self-contempt is to be loved by a clever woman.
I am afraid to show you who I really am, because if I show you who I really am, you might not like it--and that's all I got.
People often say that this or that person has not yet found himself. But the self is not something one finds, it is something one creates.
A man should first direct himself in the way he should go. Only then should he instruct others.
Self-disciplined begins with the mastery of your thoughts. If you don't control what you think, you can't control what you do. Simply, self-discipline enables you to think first and act afterward.
People love others not for who they are but for how they make them feel
They cannot take away our self-respect if we do not give it to them.
Be yourself, don't take anyone's shit, and never let them take you alive.
We talk of choosing our friends, but friends are self-elected
I have been a selfish being all my life, in practice, though not in principle.
Which painting in the National Gallery would I save if there was a fire? The one nearest the door of course.
Some cause happiness wherever they go; others whenever they go
How can a woman be expected to be happy with a man who insists on treating her as if she were a perfectly normal human being.
Not all those who wander are lost.
There is nothing like looking, if you want to find something. You certainly usually find something, if you look, but it is not always quite the something you were after.
You can only come to the morning through the shadows.
Fair speech may hide a foul heart.
The Road goes ever on and on down from the door where it began. Now far ahead the Road has gone, and I must follow, if I can, pursuing it with eager feet, until it joins some larger way where many paths and errands meet. And whither then? I cannot say.
Many that live deserve death. And some that die deserve life. Can you give it to them? Then do not be too eager to deal out death in judgement. For even the very wise cannot see all ends.
It is a dangerous business going out your front door.
It is the job that is never started that takes longest to finish.
The wise speak only of what they know.
Courage is found in unlikely places.
It does not do to leave a live dragon out of your calculations, if you live near him.
I have no help to send, therefore I must go myself.
A star shone at the hour of our meeting.
Remember what Bilbo used to say: It's a dangerous business, Frodo, going out your door. You step onto the road, and if you don't keep your feet, there's no knowing where you might be swept off to.
There are many powers in the world, for good or for evil. Some are greater than I am. Against some I have not yet been measured. But my time is coming.
All that is gold does not glitter, not all those who wander are lost; the old that is strong does not wither, deep roots are not reached by the frost. From the ashes a fire shall be woken, a light from the shadows shall spring; renenwed shall be blade that was broken, the crownless again shall be king.
I do not love the bright sword for it's sharpness, nor the arrow for it's swiftness, nor the warrior for his glory. I love only that which they defend
Let him not vow to walk in the dark, who has not seen the darkness fall.
It needs but one foe to breed a war, and those who have not swords can still die upon them
He who breaks a thing to find out what it is, has left the path of wisdom.
What do you mean? Do you wish me a good morning, or mean that it is a good morning whether I want it or not; or that you feel good on this morning; or that it is a morning to be good on?
I warn you, if you bore me, I shall take my revenge.
But that's not the way of it with the tales that really mattered, or the ones that stay in the mind. Folk seem to have just landed in them, usually - their paths were laid that way, as you put it. But I expect they had lots of chances, like us, of turning back, only they didn't. And if they had, we shouldn't know, because they'd have been forgotten. We hear about those as just went on - and not all to a good end, mind you; at least not to what folk inside a story and not outside it call a good end
I wish life was not so short, he thought. languages take such a time, and so do all the things one wants to know about.
Some who have read the book, or at any rate have reviewed it, have found it boring, absurd, or contemptible; and I have no cause to complain, since I have similar opinions of their works, or of the kinds of writing that they evidently prefer.
So comes snow after fire, and even dragons have their ending.
The wolf that one hears is worse than the orc that one fears.
What do you fear my lady? A cage. To stay behind bars until use and old age accept them and all chance of valor has gone beyond beyond recall or desire.
N-nothing important. That is, I heard a good deal about a ring, and a dark lord, and something about the end of the world, but please, Mr. Gandalf, sir, don't hurt me. Don't turn me into anything... unnatural.
If more of us valued food and cheer and song above hoarded gold, it would be a merrier world.
Do not meddle in the affairs of Wizards, for they are subtle and quick to anger.
Lord Denethor is Boromir's father. To bring him news of his beloved son's death would be most unwise. And don't mention Frodo or the ring. And say nothing of Aragorn either. In fact, it's best if you don't speak at all, Peregrin Took.
Aragorn: Hold your ground, hold your ground. Sons of Gondor, of Rohan, my brothers. I see in your eyes the same fear that would take the heart of me. A day may come when the courage of men fails, when we forsake our friends and break all bonds of fellowship, but it is not this day. An hour of wolves and shattered shields, when the age of men comes crashing down, but it is not this day. This day we fight! By all that you hold dear on this good Earth, I bid you *stand, Men of the West!*
Fealty with love, Valor with honor, oathbreaking with vengeance.
One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them
That is Shadowfax. He is cheif of the Maeras, lords of all horses, and not even Theoden, King of Rohan, has ever looked on a better. Does he not shine like silver, and run as smoothly as a swift stream?
Everything to me that is the most important, and the most moving in the book, they've gotten on the stage.
It's wisdom to recognize necessity, when all other courses have been weighed, though as folly it may appear to those who cling to false hope.
It must often be so, Sam, when things are in danger: someone has to give them up, lose them, so that others may keep them.
The world is full enough of hurts and mischance without wars to multiply them.
hope is not victory
The wide world is all about you; you can fence yourselves in, but you cannot forever fence it out.
Still round the corner there may wait, A new road or a secret gate.
He should not vow to walk in the dark, who has not seen the nightfall.
It's like things are in the world. Hopes fail. An end comes. We have only a little time to wait now.
She should not die, so young and beautiful. At least, she should not die alone.
But that's not the way of it with the tales that really mattered, or the ones that stay in the mind. Folk seem to have just landed in them, usually - their paths were laid that way, as you put it. But I expect they had lots of chances, like us, of turning back, only they didn't. And if they had, we shouldn't know, because they'd have been forgotten. We hear about those as just went on - and not all to a good end, mind you; at least not to what folk inside a story and not outside it call a good end
Then suddenly out of the gloom came a sharp hiss. 'What has it got in its pocketses?'
And it is not always good to be healed in body. Nor is it always evil to die in battle, even in bitter pain. Were I permitted, in this dark hour I would choose the latter.
A box without hinges, key, or lid, yet golden treasure inside is hid.
Now is the hour come, Riders of the Mark, sons of Eorl! Foes and fires are before you, and your homes far behind. Yet, though you fight upon an alien field, the glory that you reap there shall be your own forever. Oaths ye have taken: now fulfil them all, to lord and land and league of friendship!
I am told that I talk in shorthand and then smudge it.
I think we dream so we don't have to be apart so long. If we're in each other's dreams, we can be together all the time.
We're so busy watching out for what's just ahead of us that we don't take time to enjoy where we are.
Sometimes I think the surest sign that intelligent life exists elsewhere in the universe is that none of it has tried to contact us.
Life's disappointments are harder to take when you don't know any swear words.
Who was the first guy that look at a cow and said," I think that I'll drink whatever comes out of those things when I squeeze them?
People think it must be fun to be a super genius, but they don't realize how hard it is to put up with all the idiots in the world.
Well, remember what you said, because in a day or two, I'll have a witty and blistering retort! You'll be devastated THEN!
History is the fiction we invent to persuade ourselves that events are knowable and that life has order and direction.
I can't tell if that's funny or really scary.
Life is like topography, Hobbes. There are summits of happiness and success, flat stretches of boring routine, and valleys of frustration and failure.
You can't just turn on creativity like a faucet. You have to be in the right mood. What mood is that? Last-minute panic.
Careful. We don't want to learn from this.
County library? Reference desk, please. Hello? Yes, I need a word definition. Well, that's the problem. I don't know how to spell it and I'm not allowed to say it. Could you just rattle off all the swear words you know and I'll stop you when...Hello?
What fun is it being cool if you can't wear a sombrero?
Some days even my lucky rocketship underpants won't help.
Girls are like slugs. They serve some purpose but it's hard to imagine what.
"I've been thinking Hobbes --" "On a weekend?" "Well, it wasn't on purpose..."
Dad, how do soldiers killing each other solve the world's problems?
Do you think there is a God? ... Well, somebody's out to get me.
Don't walk away! I'm trying to apologize you dumb noodleloaf!
Talking with you is sort of the conversational equivalent of an out of body experience.
I wonder if I can grow fangs when my baby teeth fall out.
Unfortunately for my report, mom caught me and I didn't get to see how it ended.
Maybe then I can finish my book.
Success and failure are both difficult to endure. Along with success come drugs, divorce, fornication, bullying, travel, meditation, medication, depression, neurosis and suicide. With failure comes failure.
I had examined myself pretty thoroughly and discovered that I was unfit for military service.
Every writer I know has trouble writing.
Procastination is the thief of time.
I want to keep my dreams, even bad ones, because without them, I might have nothing all night long.
He had decided to live forever or die in the attempt.
The enemy is anybody who's going to get you killed, no matter which side he's on.
When I read something saying I've not done anything as good as "Catch-22" I'm tempted to reply, "Who has?"
There was only one catch and that was Catch-22, which specified that a concern for one's own safety in the face of dangers that were real and immediate was the process of a rational mind.
When I grow up I want to be a little boy.
Some people are born mediocre, some people achieve mediocrity, and some people have mediocrity thrust upon them.
He knew everything about literature except how to enjoy it.
He was a self-made man who owed his lack of success to nobody.
Frankly, I'd like to see the government get out of war altogether and leave the whole field to private industry.
Destiny is a good thing to accept when it's going your way. When it isn't, don't call it destiny; call it injustice, treachery, or simple bad luck.
I think in every country that there is at least one executive who is scared of going crazy.
But that was war. Just about all he could find in its favor was that it paid well and liberated children from the pernicious influence of their parents.
We do have a zeal for laughter in most situations, give or take a dentist.
The Lord gave us farmers two strong hands so we could grab as much as we could with both of them
Lots of people who complained about us receiving the MBE received theirs for heroism in the war - for killing people. We received ours for entertaining other people. I'd say we deserve ours more.
Rise above principal and do what's right.
Hungry Joe collected lists of fatal diseases and arranged them in alphabetical order so that he could put his finger without delay on any one he wanted to worry about.
Peace on earth would mean the end of civilization as we know it.
My drawings have been described as pre-intentionalist, meaning that they were finished before the ideas for them had occurred to me. I shall not argue the point.
I don't believe in miracles because it's been a long time since we've had any.
[(CNN) --] Everyone in my book accuses everyone else of being crazy, ... Frankly, I think the whole society is nuts -- and the question is: What does a sane man do in an insane society?
[Catch22] specified that a concern for one's safety ... was the process of a rational mind. Orr was crazy and could be grounded. All he had to do was ask, and as soon as he did, he would no longer be crazy and would have to fly more missions.
A large part of the public sentiment was my own, ... They saw an absurd quality, a mendacious quality in many of our political leaders and business leaders.
Programming is like sex: one mistake and you have to support it for the rest of your life.
It is practically impossible to teach good programming to students that have had a prior exposure to BASIC: as potential programmers they are mentally mutilated beyond hope of regeneration.
A crash is when your competitor's program dies. When your program dies, it is an 'idiosyncrasy'.
APL is a mistake, carried through to perfection. It is the language of the future for the programming techniques of the past: it creates a new generation of coding bums.
Crash programs fail because they are based on theory that, with nine women pregnant, you can get a baby in a month.
Don't blame me for the fact that competent programming, as I view it as an intellectual possibility, will be too difficult for 'the average programmer', you must not fall into the trap of rejecting a surgical technique because it is beyond the capabilities of the barber in his shop around the corner.
Measuring programming progress by lines of code is like measuring aircraft building progress by weight.
Programming graphics in X is like finding the square root of PI using Roman numerals
Copying all or parts of a program is as natural to a programmer as breathing, and as productive. It ought to be as free.
I've always said my career is somewhere between children's programming and hard-core porn.
Who can afford to do professional work for nothing? What hobbyist can put 3-man years into programming, finding all bugs, documenting his product and distribute for free? The fact is, no one besides us has invested a lot of money in hobby software.
Object-oriented programming is an exceptionally bad idea which could only have originated in California.
Low-level programming is good for the programmer's soul.
Programming is not a zero-sum game. Teaching something to a fellow programmer doesn't take it away from you. I'm happy to share what I can, because I'm in it for the love of programming.
They don't watch programs anymore; they watch pieces of programs.
Computer science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes.
Program testing can be used to show the presence of bugs, but never to show their absence!
The question of whether a computer can think is no more interesting than the question of whether a submarine can swim.
The use of COBOL cripples the mind; its teaching should, therefore, be regarded as a criminal offense.
Progress is possible only if we train ourselves to think about programs without thinking of them as pieces of executable code.
If in physics there's something you don't understand, you can always hide behind the uncharted depths of nature. You can always blame God. You didn't make it so complex yourself. But if your program doesn't work, there is no one to hide behind. You cannot hide behind an obstinate nature. If it doesn't work, you've messed up.
Don't blame me for the fact that competent programming, as I view it as an intellectual possibility, will be too difficult for 'the average programmer', you must not fall into the trap of rejecting a surgical technique because it is beyond the capabilities of the barber in his shop around the corner.
APL is a mistake, carried through to perfection. It is the language of the future for the programming techniques of the past: it creates a new generation of coding bums.
The effort of using machines to mimic the human mind has always struck me as rather silly. I would rather use them to mimic something better.
Often people, especially computer engineers, focus on the machines. They think, "By doing this, the machine will run faster. By doing this, the machine will run more effectively. By doing this, the machine will something something something." They are focusing on machines. But in fact we need to focus on humans, on how humans care about doing programming or operating the application of the machines. We are the masters. They are the slaves.
Focused, hard work is the real key to success. Keep your eyes on the goal, and just keep taking the next step towards completing it. If you aren't sure which way to do something, do it both ways and see which works better.
Focus is a matter of deciding what things you're not going to do.
It's nice to have a game that sells a million copies.
Think of what we, and others, are doing as building the largest roller coaster in the world. Rocket science is mythologized out of whack with its difficulty. Nine out of 10 people will fail, but one of us will eventually get through.
Note to self: Pasty-skinned programmers ought not stand in the Mojave desert for multiple hours.
I'd rather have a search engine or a compiler on a deserted island than a game.
The speed of light sucks.
Everybody's saturated with the marketing hype of next-generation consoles. They are wonderful, but the truth is that they are as powerful as a high end PC is right now.
Sony sort of takes this position where, [they say] 'Okay, it's going to be difficult, maybe its going to suck to do this, but the good game developers are going to suck it up and make it work.' There's some truth to that, ... There will be the developers that go ahead and have a miserable time and do get good performance out of some of these multi-core approaches. And Cell is worse than others in some respects, here.
Every program has (at least) two purposes: The one for which it was written and another for which it wasn't.
The string is a stark data structure and everywhere it is passed there is much duplication of process. It is a perfect vehicle for hiding information.
Don't have good ideas if you aren't willing to be responsible for them.
Computer Science is embarrassed by the computer.
It goes against the grain of modern education to teach students to program. What fun is there to making plans, acquiring discipline, organizing thoughts, devoting attention to detail, and learning to be self critical.
If you have a procedure with 10 parameters, you probably missed some.
Fools ignore complexity. Pragmatists suffer it. Some can avoid it. Geniuses remove it.
Symmetry is a complexity-reducing concept (co-routines include subroutines); seek it everywhere.
We toast the Lisp programmer who pens his thoughts within nests of parentheses.
I think it is inevitable that people program poorly. Training will not substantially help matters. We have to learn to live with it.
You can measure a programmer's perspective by noting his attitude on the continuing vitality of FORTRAN.
In a 5 year period we get one superb programming language - only we can't control when the 5 year period will begin.
A picture is worth 10K words - but only those to describe the picture. Hardly any sets of 10K words can be adequately described with pictures.
There are two ways to write error-free programs; only the third one works.
The computing field is always in need of new cliches.
If a listener nods his head when you're explaining your program, wake him up.
It is easier to write an incorrect program than understand a correct one.
A programming language is low level when its programs require attention to the irrelevant.
When someone says "I want a programming language in which I need only say what I wish done," give him a lollipop.
Lisp programmers know the value of everything and the cost of nothing.
In computing, turning the obvious into the useful is a living definition of the word "frustration".
It is easier to change the specification to fit the program than vice versa.
If your computer speaks English, it was probably made in Japan.
In software systems it is often the early bird that makes the worm.
A year spent in artificial intelligence is enough to make one believe in God.
Is it possible that software is not like anything else, that it is meant to be discarded: that the whole point is to always see it as a soap bubble?
Simplicity does not precede complexity, but follows it.
The best book on programming for the layman is "Alice in Wonderland"; but that's because it's the best book on anything for the layman.
Some programming languages manage to absorb change, but withstand progress.
Syntactic sugar causes cancer of the semicolon.
Friends show their love - in times of trouble, not in happiness
No one is in control of your happiness but you; therefore, you have the power to change anything about yourself or your life that you want to change.
Being deeply loved by someone gives you strength, while loving someone deeply gives you courage.
Don't marry the person you think you can live with; marry only the individual you think you can't live without.
The one thing children wear out faster than shoes is parents.
The more anger towards the past you carry in your heart, the less capable you are of loving in the present.
People do not seem to realize that their opinion of the world is also a confession of character.
Any fool can criticize, condemn, and complain but it takes character and self control to be understanding and forgiving.
Success builds character, failure reveals it
A man travels the world in search of what he needs and returns home to find it.
May you have love that never ends, lots of money and lots of friends. Health be yours, whatever you do and may God send many blessings to you.
Always do what you are afraid to do.
The key to change... is to let go of fear.
Fear of failure must never be a reason not to try something.
You don't develop courage by being happy in your relationships everyday. You develop it by surviving difficult times and challenging adversity.
Whenever you're in conflict with someone, there is one factor that can make the difference between damaging your relationship and deepening it. That factor is attitude.
The quality of your life is the quality of your relationships.
The decision to kiss for the first time is the most crucial in any love story. It changes the relationship of two people much more strongly than even the final surrender; because this kiss already has within it that surrender.
I told my psychiatrist that everyone hates me. He said I was being ridiculous - everyone hasn't met me yet.
I haven't spoken to my wife in years. I didn't want to interrupt her.

I saved a girl from being attacked last night. I controlled myself.
I looked up my family tree and found three dogs using it.

When I was a kid my parents moved a lot, but I always found them.
Some dog I got too. We call him Egypt. Because in every room he leaves a pyramid.

I was so ugly my mother used to feed me with a sling shot.
I remember the time I was kidnapped and they sent a piece of my finger to my father. He said he wanted more proof.
It's tough to stay married. My wife kisses the dog on the lips, yet she won't drink from my glass.
I came from a real tough neighborhood. I put my hand in some cement and felt another hand.
One year they wanted to make me poster boy - for birth control
I'm at the age where food has taken the place of sex in my life. In fact, I've just had a mirror put over my kitchen table.
What a dog I got, his favorite bone is in my arm.
When I was born I was so ugly the doctor slapped my mother.

What a kid I got, I told him about the birds and the bee and he told me about the butcher and my wife.
My wife is always trying to get rid of me. The other day she told me to put the garbage out. I said to her I already did. She told me to go and keep an eye on it.
I'm so ugly - I worked in a pet shop, and people kept asking how big I'd get
I drink too much. The last time I gave a urine sample it had an olive in it.
Most of the arguments to which I am party fall somewhat short of being impressive, knowing to the fact that neither I nor my opponent knows what we are talking about
This morning when I put on my underwear I could hear the fruit-of-the-loom guys laughing at me.
I told my dentist my teeth are going yellow. he told me to wear a brown tie.
With my wife I don't get no respect. I made a toast on her birthday to 'the best woman a man ever had.' The waiter joined me.
I have good looking kids. Thank goodness my wife cheats on me.
At twenty a man is full of fight and hope. He wants to reform the world. When he is seventy he still wants to reform the world, but he know he can't.

I looked up my family tree and found out I was the sap.
Yeah, I know I'm ugly... I said to a bartender, 'Make me a zombie.' He said 'God beat me to it.'
It had to be hammered home quite a bit because I didn't see any humour in my life at all.

I believe cats to be spirits come to earth. A cat, I am sure, could walk on a cloud without coming through.
Anything one man can imagine, other men can make real
The sea is everything. It covers seven tenths of the terrestrial globe. Its breath is pure and healthy. It is an immense desert, where man is never lonely, for he feels life stirring on all sides.
Science, my lad, is made up of mistakes, but they are mistakes which it is useful to make, because they lead little by little to the truth.
He believed in it, as certain good women believe in the leviathan--by faith, not by reason.
The resolutions passed at the last meeting produced a great effect out of doors. Timid people took fright at the idea of a shot weighing 20,000 pounds being launched into space; they asked what cannon could ever transmit a sufficient velocity to such a mighty mass.
We may brave human laws, but we cannot resist natural ones.
To those who were not familiar with the motions of the moon, they demonstrated that she possesses two distinct motions, the first being that of rotation upon her axis, the second being that of revolution round the earth, accomplishing both together in an equal period of time, that is to say, in twenty-seven and one-third days.
Ah, pierce me 100 times with your needles fine and I will thank you 100 times, Saint Morphine, you who Aeseulapus has made a God.
Was I to believe him in earnest in his intention to penetrate to the centre of this massive globe? Had I been listening to the mad speculations of a lunatic, or to the scientific conclusions of a lofty genius? Where did truth stop? Where did error begin?
Liberty is worth paying for ...
This forcible abduction, so roughly carried out, was accomplished with the rapidity of lightning. I shivered all over. Whom had we to deal with? No doubt some new sort of pirates, who explored the sea in their own way. Hardly had the narrow panel closed upon me, when I was enveloped in darkness.
The Nautilus was piercing the water with its sharp spur, after having accomplished nearly ten thousand leagues in three months and a half, a distance greater than the great circle of the earth. Where were we going now, and what was reserved for the future?
It was all very well for an Englishman like Mr. Fogg to make the tour of the world with a carpet-bag; a lady could not be expected to travel comfortably under such conditions.
Everybody knows that the great reversed triangle of land, with its base in the north and its apex in the south, which is called India, embraces fourteen hundred thousand square miles, upon which is spread unequally a population of one hundred and eighty millions of souls.
On the morrow the horizon was covered with clouds- a thick and impenetrable curtain between earth and sky, which unhappily extended as far as the Rocky Mountains. It was a fatality!
He rose at thirteen minutes to one, and directed his steps towards the large hall, a sumptuous apartment adorned with lavishly-framed paintings. A flunkey handed him an uncut Times, which he proceeded to cut with a skill which betrayed familiarity with this delicate operation.
We were alone. Where, I could not say, hardly imagine. All was black, and such a dense black that, after some minutes, my eyes had not been able to discern even the faintest glimmer.
On the 31st of October, at ten o'clock in the morning, the troop disembarked on the quays of Tampa Town; and one may imagine the activity which pervaded that little town, whose population was thus doubled in a single day.
The way of describing this unlooked-for scene, the history of the patriot ship, told at first so coldly, and the emotion with which this strange man pronounced the last words, the name of the Avenger, the significance of which could not escape me, all impressed itself deeply on my mind. My eyes did not leave the Captain, who, with his hand stretched out to sea, was watching with a glowing eye the glorious wreck.
It swam crossways in the direction of the Nautilus with great speed, watching us with its enormous staring green eyes. Its eight arms, or rather feet, fixed to its head, that have given the name of cephalopod to these animals, were twice as long as its body, and were twisted like the furies' hair.
How much further can we go? What are the final frontiers in this quest for travel? Will humankind only be satisfied when journeys into space become readily available and affordable?
Travel enables us to enrich our lives with new experiences, to enjoy and to be educated, to learn respect for foreign cultures, to establish friendships, and above all to contribute to international cooperation and peace throughout the world.
It is not so much our friends' help that helps us as the confident knowledge that they will help us.
What's the message in Metallica? There is no message, but if there was a message, it really should be look within yourself, don't listen to me, don't listen to James, don't listen to anybody, look within yourself for the answers.
As long as it says Metallica on the record it's Metallica.
Fascism should more appropriately be called Corporatism because it is a merger of state and corporate power
Life is really simple, but we insist on making it complicated.
Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.
Where there is shouting, there is no true knowledge.
The noblest pleasure is the joy of understanding.
As a well spent day brings happy sleep, so a life well spent brings happy death.
The eye sees a thing more clearly in dreams than the imagination awake.
I have been impressed with the urgency of doing. Knowing is not enough; we must apply. Being willing is not enough; we must do.
Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.
There are three classes of people: those who see. Those who see when they are shown. Those who do not see.
I love those who can smile in trouble, who can gather strength from distress, and grow brave by reflection.
The greatest deception men suffer is from their own opinions.
While I thought that I was learning how to live, I have been learning how to die.
Our life is made by the death of others.
If you are alone you belong entirely to yourself. If you are accompanied by even one companion you belong only half to yourself, or even less, in proportion to the thoughtlessness of his conduct; and if you have more than one companion you will fall more deeply into the same plight.
Art is never finished, only abandoned.
A well-spent day brings happy sleep
Where the spirit does not work with the hand there is no art
Time stays long enough for anyone who will use it.
You can have no dominion greater or less than that over yourself.
Iron rusts from disuse; water loses its purity from stagnation ... even so does inaction sap the vigour of the mind.
The depth and strength of a human character are defined by its moral reserves. People reveal themselves completely only when they are thrown out of the customary conditions of their life, for only then do they have to fall back on their reserves.
It's easier to resist at the beginning than at the end.
Learning never exhausts the mind
Nature never breaks her own laws
Blinding ignorance does mislead us. O! Wretched mortals, open your eyes!
Water is the driving force of all nature.
He who is fixed to a star does not change his mind.
In rivers, the water that you touch is the last of what has passed and the first of that which comes; so with present time.
Beyond a doubt truth bears the same relation to falsehood as light to darkness.
As every divided kingdom falls, so every mind divided between many studies confounds and saps itself.
Even the richest soil, if left uncultivated will produce the rankest weeds.
He who does not punish evil commands it to be done.
You do ill to praise, but worse to censure, what you do not understand
Marriage is like putting your hand into a bag of snakes in the hope of pulling out an eel.
Iron rusts from disuse, stagnant water loses its purity, and in cold weather becomes frozen, even so does inaction sap the vigors of the mind.
As a well-spent day brings happy sleep, so life well used brings happy death.
There shall be wings! If the accomplishment be not for me, 'tis for some other.
He who wishes to be rich in a day will be hanged in a year
The human foot is a masterpiece of engineering and a work of art.
The truth of things is the chief nutriment of superior intellects.
All our knowledge has its origins in our perceptions.
The function of muscle is to pull and not to push, except in the case of the genitals and the tongue.
Who sows virtue reaps honor.
He who loves practice without theory is like the sailor who boards ship without a rudder and compass and never knows where he may cast.
The smallest feline is a masterpiece.
I have wasted my hours
Human subtlety will never devise an invention more beautiful, more simple or more direct than does nature because in her inventions nothing is lacking, and nothing is superfluous.
Life well spent is long.
People react to fear, not love - they don't teach that in Sunday School, but it's true.
Learning acquired in youth arrests the evil of old age; and if you understand that old age has wisdom for its food, you will so conduct yourself in youth that your old age will not lack for nourishment.
Just as iron rusts from disuse, even so does inaction spoil the intellect.
He turns not back who is bound to a star
I have offended God and mankind because my work didn't reach the quality it should have.
The part always has a tendency to reunite with its whole in order to escape from its imperfection.
Men of lofty genius when they are doing the least work are most active.
Thirst will parch your tongue and your body will waste through lack of sleep ere you can describe in words that which painting instantly sets before the eye
Every now and then go away, have a little relaxation, for when you come back to your work your judgment will be surer. Go some distance away because then the work appears smaller and more of it can be taken in at a glance and a lack of harmony and proportion is more readily seen.
Just as courage imperils life, fear protects it.
Common Sense is that which judges the things given to it by other senses.
Painting is poetry that is seen rather than felt, and poetry is painting that is felt rather than seen
Experience does not err. Only your judgments err by expecting from her what is not in her power.
The most praiseworthy form of painting is one that most resembles what it imitates.
The desire to know is natural to good men.
I roamed the countryside searching for answers to things I did not understand. Why thunder lasts longer than that which causes it, and why immediately on its creation the lightning becomes visible to the eye while thunder requires time to travel.
The men of experiment are like the ant; they only collect and use. But the bee . . . gathers its materials from the flowers of the garden and of the field, but transforms and digests it by a power of its own.
Experience does not ever err; it is only your judgment that errs in promising itself results which are not caused by your experiments
A good painter is to paint two main things, men and the working of man's mind.
Intellectual passion drives out sensuality
Many have made a trade of delusions and false miracles, deceiving the stupid multitude.
Patience serves as a protection against wrongs as clothes do against cold. For if you put on more clothes as the cold increases, it will have no power to hurt you. So in like manner you must grow in patience when you meet with great wrongs, and they
Wisdom is the daughter of experience.
Thou, O God, dost sell us all good things at the price of labor
The art of procreation and the members employed therein are so repulsive, that if it were not for the beauty of the faces and the adornments of the actors and the pent-up impulse, nature would lose the human species.
Anyone who conducts an argument by appealing to authority is not using his intelligence he is just using his memory
Just as eating contrary to the inclination is injurious to the health, so study without desire sports the memory, and it retains nothing that it takes in.
No member needs so great a number of muscles as the tongue; this exceeds all the rest in the number of its movements
Nature is full of infinite causes that have never occurred in experience.
Although nature commences with reason and ends in experience it is necessary for us to do the opposite, that is to commence with experience and from this to proceed to investigate the reason.
The poet ranks far below the painter in the representation of visible things, and far below the musician in that of invisible things.
Nothing can be love or hated unless it is first known.
I have learned from an early age to abjured the use of meat, and the time will come when men such as I will look upon the murder of animals as they now look upon the murder of men
Obstacles cannot crush me. Every obstacle yields to stern resolve. He who is fixed to a star does not change his mind.
When once you have tasted flight, you will forever walk the earth with your eyes turned skyward, for there you have been, and there you will always long to return.
Intellectual passion dries out sensuality.

Finding the right Question is more valuable and rewarding than finding the right Answer.
Fall seven times, stand up eight.
I'm a great believer in luck, and I find the harder I work the more I have of it.
The race is not always to the swift, but to those who keep on running.
Dare to be Great
Winners never quit and quitters never win.
I hated every minute of training, but I said, ''Don't quit. Suffer now and live the rest of your life as a champion.''

If you can do a half-assed job of anything, you're a one-eyed man in a kingdom of the blind.
Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.
Fortune sides with he who dares.
The only certain means of success is to render more and better service than is expected of you, no matter what your task may be. This is a habit followed by all successful people since the beginning of time. Therefore I say the surest way to doom yourself to mediocrity is to perform only the work for which you are paid.
Stubbornly persist, and you will find that the limits of your stubbornness go well beyond the stubbornness of your limits.
Make the most of yourself, for that is all there is of you.
Sweat is the cologne of accomplishment.
Courage is not the lack of fear. It is acting in spite of it.
A great deal of talent is lost to the world for want of a little courage. Every day sends to their graves obscure men whose timidity prevented them from making a first effort.
A ship in harbor is safe, but that is not what ships are built for.
A pessimist sees the difficulty in every opportunity; an optimist sees the opportunity in every difficulty.
Some people dream of success while others wake up and work hard at it.
The only place where success comes before work is in the dictionary.
We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, therefore, is not an act but a habit.
Thousands of geniuses live and die undiscovered - either by themselves or by others.
Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful people could change the world. Indeed, it's the only thing that ever has.
I'd rather be a failure at something I enjoy than a success at something I hate.
If we are facing in the right direction, all we have to do is keep on walking.
When you come to the end of your rope, tie a knot and hang on.

Benjamin Franklin's Thirteen Virtues  1. Temperance. Eat not to dullness; drink not to elevation. 2. Silence. Speak not but what may benefit others or yourself; avoid trifling conversation. 3. Order. Let all your things have their places; let each part of your business have its time. 4. Resolution. Resolve to perform what you ought; perform without fail what you resolve. 5. Frugality. Make no expense but to do good to others or yourself; i.e., waste nothing. 6. Industry. Lose no time; be always employ'd in something useful; cut off all unnecessary actions. 7. Sincerity. Use no hurtful deceit; think innocently and justly, and, if you speak, speak accordingly. 8. Justice. Wrong none by doing injuries, or omitting the benefits that are your duty. 9. Moderation. Avoid extreams; forbear resenting injuries so much as you think they deserve. 10. Cleanliness. Tolerate no uncleanliness in body, cloaths, or habitation. 11. Tranquility. Be not disturbed at trifles, or at accidents common or unavoidable. 12. Chastity. Rarely use venery but for health or offspring, never to dulness, weakness, or the injury of your own or another's peace or reputation. 13. Humility. Imitate Jesus and Socrates.

Peace comes from within. Do not seek it without.
All that we are is the result of what we have thought. The mind is everything. What we think we become.
You will not be punished for your anger, you will be punished by your anger.
The whole secret of existence is to have no fear. Never fear what will become of you, depend on no one. Only the moment you reject all help are you freed.

Remember, remember, the 5th of November The Gunpowder Treason and plot; I know of no reason why Gunpowder Treason Should ever be forgot.
I don't think that combat has ever been written about truthfully; it has always been described in terms of bravery and cowardice. I won't even accept these words as terms of human reference any more. And anyway, hell, they don't even apply to what, in actual fact, modern warfare has become.
Do not wait for the Last Judgment. It takes place every day.
The important thing is to pull yourself up by your own hair to turn yourself inside out and see the whole world with fresh eyes
To love another is something like prayer and it can't be planned, you just fall into its arms because your belief undoes your disbelief.
There's never been a true war that wasn't fought between two sets of people who were certain they were in the right. The really dangerous people believe they are doing whatever they are doing solely and only because it is without question the right thing to do. And that is what makes them dangerous.
To be what we are, and to become what we are capable of becoming, is the only end of life.
A moment comes, which comes but rarely in history, when we step out from the old to the new, when an age ends, and when the soul of a nation, long suppressed, finds utterance.
The deepest feeling always shows itself in silence; not in silence, but restraint.
We must face problems which do not lend themselves to easy or quick or permanent solutions. And we must face the fact that the United States is neither omnipotent nor omniscient, that we are only six percent of the world's population, that we cannot impose our will upon the other ninety-four percent of mankind, that we cannot right every wrong or reverse each adversity, and that therefore there cannot be an American solution to every world problem.
It requires twenty years for a man to rise from the vegetable state in which he is within his mother's womb, and from the pure animal state which is the lot of his early childhood, to the state when the maturity of reason begins to appear. It has required thirty centuries to learn a little about his structure. It would need eternity to learn something about his soul. It takes an instant to kill him.
To see a World in a Grain of Sand And a Heaven in a Wild Flower, Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand And Eternity in an hour.

The great mistake is to anticipate the outcome of the engagement; you ought not to be thinking of whether it ends in victory or defeat. Let nature take its course, and your tools will strike at the right moment.

Notice that the stiffest tree is most easily cracked, while the bamboo or willow survives by bending with the wind.
A quick temper will make a fool of you soon enough.
Forget about winning and losing; forget about pride and pain. Let your opponent graze your skin and you smash into his flesh; let him smash into your flesh and you fracture his bones; let him fracture your bones and you take his life! Do not be concerned with escaping safely- lay your life before him!!
If there is a God, he is within. You don't ask God to give you things, you depend on God for your inner theme.
A good teacher protects his pupils from his own influence.

You must be shapeless, formless, like water. When you pour water in a cup, it becomes the cup. When you pour water in a bottle, it becomes the bottle. When you pour water in a teapot, it becomes the teapot. Water can drip and it can crash. Become like water my friend.
Self-knowledge involves relationship. To know oneself is to study one self in action with another person. Relationship is a process of self evaluation and self revelation. Relationship is the mirror in which you discover yourself - to be is to be related.

People assume that time is a strict progression of cause to effect, but *actually* from a non-linear, non-subjective viewpoint - it's more like a big ball of wibbly wobbly... time-y wimey... stuff.
There are worlds out there where the sky is burning, where the sea's asleep and the rivers dream, people made of smoke and cities made of song. Somewhere there's danger, somewhere there's injustice and somewhere else the tea is getting cold. Come on, Ace, we've got work to do.

And I have no doubt that every new example will succeed, as every past one has done, in showing that religion and Government will both exist in greater purity, the less they are mixed together.
America was indebted to immigration for her settlement and prosperity. That part of America which had encouraged them most had advanced most rapidly in population, agriculture and the arts.
The means of defense against foreign danger historically have become the instruments of tyranny at home.
A popular government without popular information or the means of acquiring it, is but a prologue to a farce, or a tragedy, or perhaps both.

The capacity of the female mind for studies of the highest order cannot be doubted, having been sufficiently illustrated by its works of genius, of erudition, and of science.
The people are the only legitimate fountain of power, and it is from them that the constitutional charter, under which the several branches of government hold their power, is derived.
There is no maxim, in my opinion, which is more liable to be misapplied, and which, therefore, more needs elucidation, than the current one, that the interest of the majority is the political standard of right and wrong.
In framing a government which is to be administered by men over men you must first enable the government to control the governed; and in the next place oblige it to control itself.
Of all the enemies of public liberty, war is perhaps the most to be dreaded, because it comprises and develops the germ of every other.
War should only be declared by the authority of the people, whose toils and treasures are to support its burdens, instead of the government which is to reap its fruits.
I have no doubt but that the misery of the lower classes will be found to abate whenever the Government assumes a freer aspect and the laws favor a subdivision of Property.
The essence of Government is power; and power, lodged as it must be in human hands, will ever be liable to abuse.
As a man is said to have a right to his property, he may be equally said to have a property in his rights.
By rendering the labor of one, the property of the other, they cherish pride, luxury, and vanity on one side; on the other, vice and servility, or hatred and revolt.
The truth is that all men having power ought to be mistrusted.
As long as the reason of man continues fallible, and he is at liberty to exercise it, different opinions will be formed.
The diversity in the faculties of men, from which the rights of property originate, is not less an insuperable obstacle to an uniformity of interests. The protection of these faculties is the first object of government.
The executive has no right, in any case, to decide the question, whether there is or is not cause for declaring war.
To suppose that any form of government will secure liberty or happiness without any virtue in the people, is a chimerical idea.
What is government itself but the greatest of all reflections on human nature? If men were angels, no government would be necessary. If angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary.
A pure democracy is a society consisting of a small number of citizens, who assemble and administer the government in person.
A sincere and steadfast co-operation in promoting such a reconstruction of our political system as would provide for the permanent liberty and happiness of the United States.
Ambition must be made to counteract ambition.
Commercial shackles are generally unjust, oppressive, and impolitic.

Perhaps it is a universal truth that the loss of liberty at home is to be charged to provisions against danger, real or pretended, from abroad.
We are right to take alarm at the first experiment upon our liberties.

Every nation whose affairs betray a want of wisdom and stability may calculate on every loss which can be sustained from the more systematic policy of its wiser neighbors.
Religious bondage shackles and debilitates the mind and unfits it for every noble enterprise, every expanded prospect.
The advancement and diffusion of knowledge is the only guardian of true liberty.
The personal right to acquire property, which is a natural right, gives to property, when acquired, a right to protection, as a social right.

Any reading not of a vicious species must be a good substitute for the amusements too apt to fill up the leisure of the labouring classes.
I should not regret a fair and full trial of the entire abolition of capital punishment.
If we are to take for the criterion of truth the majority of suffrages, they ought to be gotten from those philosophic and patriotic citizens who cultivate their reason.
Learned Institutions ought to be favorite objects with every free people. They throw that light over the public mind which is the best security against crafty and dangerous encroachments on the public liberty.
Religion flourishes in greater purity, without than with the aid of Government.
The internal effects of a mutable policy poisons the blessings of liberty itself.
The number, the industry, and the morality of the priesthood, and the devotion of the people have been manifestly increased by the total separation of the church from the state.
To the press alone, chequered as it is with abuses, the world is indebted for all the triumphs which have been gained by reason and humanity over error and oppression.
War contains so much folly, as well as wickedness, that much is to be hoped from the progress of reason.
What spectacle can be more edifying or more seasonable, than that of Liberty and Learning, each leaning on the other for their mutual and surest support?

Excuse me, I have five pages. May I use the Xerox machine because I have to make some copies? The result was that once again nearly all (93 percent) agreed, even though no real reason, no new information, was added to justify their compliance. Just as the "cheep-cheep” sound of turkey chicks triggered an automatic mothering response from maternal turkeys—even when it emanated from a stuffed polecat—so, too, did the word "because” trigger an automatic compliance response
Embarrassment is a villain to be crushed.
The customers, mostly well-to-do vacationers with little knowledge of turquoise, were using a standard principle—a stereotype—to guide their buying: "expensive = good".
The automatic, fixed-action patterns of these animals work very well the great majority of the time. For example, because only healthy, normal turkey chicks make the peculiar sound of baby turkeys, it makes sense for mother turkeys to respond maternally to that single "cheep-cheep” noise.
A well-known principle of human behavior says that when we ask someone to do us a favor we will be more successful if we provide a reason. People simply like to have reasons for what they do
Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity
Nothing is less productive than to make more efficient what should not be done at all.

A man's gotta make at least one bet a day, else he could be walking around lucky and never know it
Those who don't give a fuck change the world. The rest do not
Even a happy life cannot be without a measure of darkness, and the word happy would lose its meaning if it were not balanced by sadness. It is far better take things as they come along with patience and equanimity.

Through pride we are ever deceiving ourselves. But deep down below the surface of the average conscience a still, small voice says to us, something is out of tune.

Who has fully realized that history is not contained in thick books but lives in our very blood?
It all depends on how we look at things, and not how they are in themselves.
We should not pretend to understand the world only by the intellect. The judgement of the intellect is only part of the truth.
It is a fact that cannot be denied: the wickedness of others becomes our own wickedness because it kindles something evil in our own hearts.
We are born at a given moment, in a given place and, like vintage years of wine, we have the qualities of the year and of the season of which we are born. Astrology does not lay claim to anything more.
Nobody, as long as he moves about among the chaotic currents of life, is without trouble.
Neurosis is always a substitute for legitimate suffering.
The creation of something new is not accomplished by the intellect but by the play instinct acting from inner necessity. The creative mind plays with the objects it loves.

Our heart glows, and secret unrest gnaws at the root of our being. Dealing with the unconscious has become a question of life for us.
I have treated many hundreds of patients. Among those in the second half of life - that is to say, over 35 - there has not been one whose problem in the last resort was not that of finding a religious outlook on life.
Love is the great miracle cure. Loving ourselves works miracles in our lives.
As my mind can conceive of more good, the barriers and blocks dissolve. My life becomes full of little miracles popping up out of the blue.
No person, no place, and no thing has any power over us, for 'we' are the only thinkers in our mind. When we create peace and harmony and balance in our minds, we will find it in our lives.
If you want to understand your parents more, get them to talk about their own childhood; and if you listen with compassion, you will learn where their fears and rigid patterns come from. Those people who 'did all that stuff to you' were just as frightened and scared as you are.
We choose our sex, our color, our country, and then we look around for the particular set of parents who will mirror the pattern we are bringing in to work on in this lifetime.
I find that when we really love and accept and approve of ourselves exactly as we are, then everything in life works.
Remember, in the vast infinity of life, all is perfect, whole, and complete... and so are you.

We are each responsible for all of our experiences.
The point of power is always in the present moment.

We learn our belief systems as very little children, and then we move through life creating experiences to match our beliefs. Look back in your own life and notice how often you have gone through the same experience.
Every thought we think is creating our future.
If your mother did not know how to love herself, or your father did not know how to love himself, then it would be impossible for them to teach you to love yourself. They were doing the best they could with what they had been taught as children.
It is essential that we stop worrying about money and stop resenting our bills.
Know that you are always safe. And also know that it's possible to move from the old to the new, easily and peacefully.
It seems to me that everyone on this planet whom I know or have worked with is suffering from self-hatred and guilt to one degree or another. The more self-hatred and guilt we have, the less our lives work. The less self-hatred and guilt we have, the better our lives work, on all levels.
I am in the right place, at the right time, doing the right thing.
You have the power to heal your life, and you need to know that. We think so often that we are helpless, but we're not. We always have the power of our minds…Claim and consciously use your power.
I have never understood the importance of having children memorize battle dates. It seems like such a waste of mental energy. Instead, we could teach them important subjects such as How the Mind Works, How to Handle Finances, How to Invest Money for Financial Security, How to be a Parent, How to Create Good Relationships, and How to Create and Maintain Self-Esteem and Self-Worth. Can you imagine what a whole generation of adults would be like if they had been taught these subjects in school along with their regular curriculum?
No matter where we live on the planet or how difficult our situation seems to be, we have the ability to overcome and transcend our circumstances
I am willing to release the need to be unworthy. I am worthy of the very best in life, and I now lovingly allow myself to accept it
I will not be distracted by noise, chatter, or setbacks. Patience, commitment, grace, and purpose will guide me
When we expand our thinking and beliefs our love flows freely. When we contract we shut ourselves off. Can you remember the last time when you were in love? Your heart went ahhh!! It was such a wonderful feeling. It is the same with loving yourself except that you will never leave once you have your love for yourself.Its with you for the rest of your life, so you want to make it the best relationship that you can have
I have noticed that the Universe loves Gratitude. The more Grateful you are, the more goodies you get
I say "Out" to every negative thought that comes to my mind. No person, place, or thing has any power over me, for I am the only thinker in my mind. I create my own reality and everyone in it.
In the infinity of life where I am, All is perfect, whole and complete, I no longer choose to believe in old limitations and lack, I now choose to begin to see myself As the Universe sees me --- perfect, whole, and complete.
Your unique creative talents and abilities are flowing through you and are being expressed in deeply satisfying ways. Your creativity is always in demand.
You've been criticising yourself for years and it hasn't worked. Try approving of yourself and see what happens.
I change my life when I change my thinking. I am Light. I am Spirit. I am a wonderful, capable being. And it is time for me to acknowledge that I create my own reality with my thoughts. If I want to change my reality, then it is time for me to change my mind.
Deep at the center of my being there is an infinite well of love.
The mental thought patterns that cause the most dis-ease in the body are CRITICISM, ANGER, RESENTMENT and GUILT. For instance, criticism indulged in long enought will often lead to dis-eases such as arthritis. Anger turns into things that boil and burn and infect the body. Resentment long held festers and eats away at the self and ultimately can lead to tumors and cancer. Guilt always seeks punishment and leads to pain.
Well, I believe you created those experiences over and over because they mirrored something you believed about yourself. It doesn't really matter how long we have had a problem, or how big it is, or how life-threatening it is. The Point of Power Is Always in the Present Moment
The thoughts we choose to think are the tools we use to paint the canvas of our lives
No matter where you are in life, no matter what you've contributed to creating, no matter what's happening, you are always doing the best you can with the understanding and awareness and knowledge that you have
Every day declare for yourself what you want in life. Declare it as though you have it!
Be willing to take the first step, no matter how small it is. Concentrate on the fact that you are willing to learn. Absolute miracles will happen.
We want to know what is going on inside us, so we can know what to let go. Instead of hiding our pain, we can release it totally.
Chronic patterns of self-hate, guilt, and self-criticism raise the body's stress levels and weaken the immune system
A tragedy can turn out to be our greatest good if we approach it in ways from which we can grow
We are far more than our bodies and personalities. The inner spirit is always beautiful and lovable, no matter how our outer appearances may change
When we forgive and let go, not only does a huge weight drop off your shoulders, but the doorway to your own self-love opens
If you can't get close to other people, it is because you don't know how to be close to your own inner child. The child in you is scared and hurting. Be there for your child
All the theories in the world are useless unless there is action, positive change, and finally, healing
When we get frightened, we want to control everything, and then we shut off the flow of our good. Trust life. Everything we need is here for us
When our inner vision opens, our horizons expand
Each one of us is totally linked with the Universe and with all of life. The Power is within us to expand the horizons of our consciousness
The planet is becoming conscious as a whole. It is becoming self-conscious
Some people would rather leave the planet than change
We can destroy the planet or heal it. Send some loving, healing energy to the planet every day. What we do with our minds makes a difference

I am a very superstitious person.
I am open to everything.
I want to be famous everywhere.
I want to reach as many people as possible with the message of music, of wonderful opera.
I'm a perfectionist, and I always think that I can do better what I have done, even if it's good.
It is a very honest world, our work. I think you cannot fake anything.
Opera is one of the most important art forms. It should be listened to and appreciated by everyone.
People have a right to criticize.
Sometime to be called Pavarotti is not always an advantage.
The music itself could never take the place of my own passion in life.
There is no prodigy in our profession. If you see all the great singer of the past, none of them are.
In opera, as with any performing art, to be in great demand and to command high fees you must be good of course, but you must also be famous. The two are different things.
One of the very nicest things about life is the way we must regularly stop whatever it is we are doing and devote our attention to eating.
If you know why you fall in love, you aren't in love
People think I'm disciplined. It is not discipline. It is devotion. There is a great difference.
Learning music by reading about it is like making love by mail.
Nothing that has happened has made me feel gloomy or remain depressed. I love my life
We shall defend our island, whatever the cost may be, we shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender.
The release of atomic energy has not created a new problem. It has merely made more urgent the necessity of solving an existing one.
Wars are poor chisels for carving out peaceful tomorrows.
We must concentrate not merely on the negative expulsion of war but the postive affirmation of peace.
One of the greatest casualties of the war in Vietnam is the Great Society... shot down on the battlefield of Vietnam.
He who joyfully marches to music in rank and file has already earned my contempt. He has been given a large brain by mistake, since for him the spinal cord would suffice.
It is incumbent on every generation to pay its own debts as it goes. A principle which if acted on would save one-half the wars of the world.
Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired, signifies in the final sense a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed.
The cost of freedom is always high, but Americans have always paid it. And one path we shall never choose, and that is the path of surrender, or submission.
In wartime, truth is so precious that she should always be attended by a bodyguard of lies.
No bastard ever won a war by dying for his country. He won it by making the other poor dumb bastard die for his country.
Build me a son, O Lord, who will be strong enough to know when he is weak, and brave enough to face himself when he is afraid, one who will be proud and unbending in honest defeat, and humble and gentle in victory.
I am not afraid of an army of lions led by a sheep; I am afraid of an army of sheep led by a lion.
When the war of the giants is over the wars of the pygmies will begin.
War will exist until that distant day when the conscientious objector enjoys the same reputation and prestige that the warrior does today.
The soldier above all others prays for peace, for it is the soldier who must suffer and bear the deepest wounds and scars of war.
The best weapon against an enemy is another enemy.
Never think that war, no matter how necessary, nor how justified, is not a crime.
There was never a good war, or a bad peace.
Victorious warriors win first and then go to war, while defeated warriors go to war first and then seek to win.
Humankind has not woven the web of life. We are but one thread within it. Whatever we do to the web, we do to ourselves. All things are bound together. All things connect.
All things share the same breath - the beast, the tree, the man... the air shares its spirit with all the life it supports.
When the last red man shall have perished from the earth and his memory among the white men shall have become a myth, these shores will swarm with the invisible dead of my tribe. The white man will never be alone. Let him be just and deal kindly with my people, for the dead are not powerless.
What is man without the beasts? For if all the beast were gone, man would die of a great loneliness of the spirit.
There is no death, only a change of worlds.
Humans merely share the earth. We can only protect the land, not own it.
Tribe follows tribe, and nation follows nation, like the waves of the sea. It is the order of nature, and regret is useless.
Youth is impulsive. When our young men grow angry at some real or imaginary wrong, and disfigure their faces with black paint, it denotes that their hearts are black, and that they are often cruel and relentless, and our old men and old women are unable to restrain them. Thus it has ever been.
Revenge by young men is considered gain, even at the cost of their own lives, but old men who stay at home in times of war, and mothers who have sons to lose, know better.
Man does not weave this web of life. He is merely a strand of it. Whatever he does to the web, he does to himself.
If we do not own the freshness of the air and the sparkle of the water, how can you buy them?
Our religion is the traditions of our ancestors - the dreams of our old men, given them in solemn hours of the night by the Great Spirit; and the visions of our sachems, and is written in the hearts of our people.
Day and night cannot dwell together. The Red Man has ever fled the approach of the White Man, as the morning mist flees before the morning sun.
Whatever Seattle says, the great chief at Washington can rely upon with as much certainty as he can upon the return of the sun or the seasons.
Our people are ebbing away like a rapidly receding tide that will never return. The white man's God cannot love our people, or He would protect them.
To us, the ashes of our ancestors are sacred and their resting place is hallowed ground.
My people are few. They resemble the scattering trees of a storm-swept plain.
Our greatest weakness lies in giving up. The most certain way to succeed is always to try just one more time.
Always do your best. What you plant now, you will harvest later.
Problems are not stop signs, they are guidelines.
You are never too old to set another goal or to dream a new dream.
Believe in yourself! Have faith in your abilities! Without a humble but reasonable confidence in your own powers you cannot be successful or happy.
Step by step and the thing is done.
Start where you are. Use what you have. Do what you can.
A creative man is motivated by the desire to achieve, not by the desire to beat others.
If you can dream it, you can do it.
The will to win, the desire to succeed, the urge to reach your full potential... these are the keys that will unlock the door to personal excellence.
With the new day comes new strength and new thoughts.
You have to learn the rules of the game. And then you have to play better than anyone else.
In order to succeed, we must first believe that we can.
Don't watch the clock; do what it does. Keep going.
Expect problems and eat them for breakfast.
Even if you fall on your face, you're still moving forward.
Optimism is the faith that leads to achievement. Nothing can be done without hope and confidence.
What you get by achieving your goals is not as important as what you become by achieving your goals.
Do you want to know who you are? Don't ask. Act! Action will delineate and define you.
By failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail.
I don't believe you have to be better than everybody else. I believe you have to be better than you ever thought you could be.
Change your life today. Don't gamble on the future, act now, without delay.
Knowing is not enough; we must apply. Willing is not enough; we must do.
Infuse your life with action. Don't wait for it to happen. Make it happen. Make your own future. Make your own hope. Make your own love. And whatever your beliefs, honor your creator, not by passively waiting for grace to come down from upon high, but by doing what you can to make grace happen... yourself, right now, right down here on Earth.
Do the difficult things while they are easy and do the great things while they are small. A journey of a thousand miles must begin with a single step.
I know where I'm going and I know the truth, and I don't have to be what you want me to be. I'm free to be what I want.
Consult not your fears but your hopes and your dreams. Think not about your frustrations, but about your unfulfilled potential. Concern yourself not with what you tried and failed in, but with what it is still possible for you to do.
The key is to keep company only with people who uplift you, whose presence calls forth your best.
If you don't design your own life plan, chances are you'll fall into someone else's plan. And guess what they have planned for you? Not much.
Without hard work, nothing grows but weeds.
Setting goals is the first step in turning the invisible into the visible.
Be Impeccable With Your Word. Speak with integrity. Say only what you mean. Avoid using the word to speak against yourself or to gossip about others. Use the power of your word in the direction of truth and love.
Pursue one great decisive aim with force and determination.
If you're going through hell, keep going.
We are taught you must blame your father, your sisters, your brothers, the school, the teachers - but never blame yourself. It's never your fault. But it's always your fault, because if you wanted to change you're the one who has got to change.
Learn from the past, set vivid, detailed goals for the future, and live in the only moment of time over which you have any control: now.
Do something wonderful, people may imitate it.
Never, never, never give up.
You are not here merely to make a living. You are here in order to enable the world to live more amply, with greater vision, with a finer spirit of hope and achievement. You are here to enrich the world, and you impoverish yourself if you forget the errand.
I've worked too hard and too long to let anything stand in the way of my goals. I will not let my teammates down and I will not let myself down.
I learned that we can do anything, but we can't do everything... at least not at the same time. So think of your priorities not in terms of what activities you do, but when you do them. Timing is everything.
Quality is not an act, it is a habit.
After a storm comes a calm.
Do not wait to strike till the iron is hot; but make it hot by striking.
Opportunity does not knock, it presents itself when you beat down the door.
Things do not happen. Things are made to happen.
Don't give up. Dont lost hope. Deon't sell out.
Ever tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try Again. Fail again. Fail better.
One finds limits by pushing them.
I'd rather attempt to do something great and fail than to attempt to do nothing and succeed.
Know or listen to those who know.
Do not wait; the time will never be 'just right.' Start where you stand, and work with whatever tools you may have at your command, and better tools will be found as you go along.
Either you run the day or the day runs you.
What you do today can improve all your tomorrows.
True happiness involves the full use of one's power and talents.
If you want to succeed you should strike out on new paths, rather than travel the worn paths of accepted success.
Do the one thing you think you cannot do. Fail at it. Try again. Do better the second time. The only people who never tumble are those who never mount the high wire. This is your moment. Own it.
Perseverance is not a long race; it is many short races one after the other.
Be miserable. Or motivate yourself. Whatever has to be done, it's always your choice.
Big shots are only little shots who keep shooting.
There is always room at the top.
You can never quit. Winners never quit, and quitters never win.
If you fell down yesterday, stand up today.
Only I can change my life. No one can do it for me.
Learning is the beginning of wealth. Learning is the beginning of health. Learning is the beginning of spirituality. Searching and learning is where the miracle process all begins.
Do your work with your whole heart, and you will succeed - there's so little competition.
Where there is a will, there is a way. If there is a chance in a million that you can do something, anything, to keep what you want from ending, do it. Pry the door open or, if need be, wedge your foot in that door and keep it open.
Set your goals high, and don't stop till you get there.
Be gentle to all and stern with yourself.
A goal is a dream with a deadline.
Follow your dreams, work hard, practice and persevere. Make sure you eat a variety of foods, get plenty of exercise and maintain a healthy lifestyle.
The most effective way to do it, is to do it.
You just can't beat the person who never gives up.
I've found that luck is quite predictable. If you want more luck, take more chances. Be more active. Show up more often.
The ultimate aim of the ego is not to see something, but to be something.
The first step toward success is taken when you refuse to be a captive of the environment in which you first find yourself.
Motivation is the art of getting people to do what you want them to do because they want to do it.
The past cannot be changed. The future is yet in your power.
Determine never to be idle. No person will have occasion to complain of the want of time who never loses any. It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing.
March on. Do not tarry. To go forward is to move toward perfection. March on, and fear not the thorns, or the sharp stones on life's path.
The harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph.
You can't build a reputation on what you are going to do.
Act as if what you do makes a difference. It does.
The people who influence you are the people who believe in you.
Set your sights high, the higher the better. Expect the most wonderful things to happen, not in the future but right now. Realize that nothing is too good. Allow absolutely nothing to hamper you or hold you up in any way.
The hardships that I encountered in the past will help me succeed in the future.
In motivating people, you've got to engage their minds and their hearts. I motivate people, I hope, by example - and perhaps by excitement, by having productive ideas to make others feel involved.
Decide what you want, decide what you are willing to exchange for it. Establish your priorities and go to work.
I am not afraid... I was born to do this.
Whatever you want in life, other people are going to want it too. Believe in yourself enough to accept the idea that you have an equal right to it.
Go for it now. The future is promised to no one.
Perseverance is failing 19 times and succeeding the 20th.
The will to succeed is important, but what's more important is the will to prepare.
I really believe that everyone has a talent, ability, or skill that he can mine to support himself and to succeed in life.
Who seeks shall find.
Never complain and never explain.
Decide that you want it more than you are afraid of it.
I think people who are creative are the luckiest people on earth. I know that there are no shortcuts, but you must keep your faith in something Greater than You, and keep doing what you love. Do what you love, and you will find the way to get it out to the world.
When you fail you learn from the mistakes you made and it motivates you to work even harder.
Press forward. Do not stop, do not linger in your journey, but strive for the mark set before you.
Always continue the climb. It is possible for you to do whatever you choose, if you first get to know who you are and are willing to work with a power that is greater than ourselves to do it.
One way to keep momentum going is to have constantly greater goals.
The more man meditates upon good thoughts, the better will be his world and the world at large.
If you want to conquer fear, don't sit home and think about it. Go out and get busy.
If you don't like how things are, change it! You're not a tree.
No matter how many goals you have achieved, you must set your sights on a higher one.
The wise does at once what the fool does at last.
It's always too early to quit.
You need to overcome the tug of people against you as you reach for high goals.
Poverty was the greatest motivating factor in my life.
Small deeds done are better than great deeds planned.
You can't expect to hit the jackpot if you don't put a few nickels in the machine.
The turning point was when I hit my 30th birthday. I thought, if really want to write, it's time to start. I picked up the book How to Write a Novel in 90 Days. The author said to just write three pages a day, and I figured, I can do this. I never got past Page 3 of that book.
Never give in and never give up.
Follow your inner moonlight; don't hide the madness.
If you think you can do it, you can.
We make the world we live in and shape our own environment.
You have to make it happen.
The dog that trots about finds a bone.
Always desire to learn something useful.
Don't brood. Get on with living and loving. You don't have forever.
The weeds keep multiplying in our garden, which is our mind ruled by fear. Rip them out and call them by name.
To be a good loser is to learn how to win.
Wherever you are - be all there.
Don't fight the problem, decide it.
I was motivated to be different in part because I was different.
Go big or go home. Because it's true. What do you have to lose?
You can't wait for inspiration. You have to go after it with a club.
You create your opportunities by asking for them.
There is nothing deep down inside us except what we have put there ourselves.
A will finds a way.
I can, therefore I am.
To know oneself, one should assert oneself.

Your heaviest artillery will be your will to live. Keep that big gun going.
Be thine own palace, or the world's thy jail.
To begin, begin.
One of the things that I did before I ran for president is I was a professional speaker. Not a motivational speaker - an inspirational speaker. Motivation comes from within. You have to be inspired. That's what I do. I inspire people, I inspire the public, I inspire my staff. I inspired the organizations I took over to want to succeed.
I'm thrilled to continue my partnership with U by Kotex for Generation Know while helping to empower girls. I've always been a motivational resource for my younger sisters and hope I can positively impact and inspire other young girls too.
Giving back, doing motivational speeches and stuff like that, that's always made me feel good. If you repeatedly go out there, and you are the change that you want to see, then that's what you are.
Oh, I would love to be a motivational speaker. I have pulled myself out of a million potholes, and I can see the potholes ahead of me. That doesn't mean that I could always do that so perfectly for my own life. I totally fall in potholes.
Typically, if you reward something, you get more of it. You punish something, you get less of it. And our businesses have been built for the last 150 years very much on that kind of motivational scheme.
I believe that any type of education can be great, but an education about ourselves can create something wonderful. I am a comedian, but people have called me a motivational speaker. I don't really consider myself that at all.
I like to put on hardcore when I have to clean my apartment, which I hate to do, but it's motivational. I like old heavy metal when I'm outside working on my car. Music has definite functions for me.
I like motivational books, because I like the go-getting American spirit - your destiny is in your own hands, life is what you make it, don't accept your limitations, jump before you're pushed, leap before you look.
Success is the only motivational factor that a boy with character needs.
One day, I got so disgusted that I sat down and wrote a list called 'Justin's list of things to do before he kicks the bucket.' I wrote it for myself and shortened it to 'Justin's Bucket List.' It was there on the wall, not as a story idea but as a motivational tool for myself, which actually ended up working pretty well.
I realized I love motivating and I love empowering and I love inspiring people. I did that as an athlete for 18 years, and I am able to do that as a motivational speaker now as well as doing work on television.
I've always thought of acting as more of an exercise in empathy, which is not to be confused with sympathy. You're trying to get inside a certain emotional reality or motivational reality and try to figure out what that's about so you can represent it.
I went to a motivational training course once, a course of self-discovery, and I found out after a week that my fear - it was not a fear of not being accepted - was a very violent fear of failure.
As long as I'm not selling out the people that ride or die with me, I'm glad I'm not an MC. I'm a motivational speaker. I'm not that rapper dude.
Religious speech is extreme, emotional, and motivational. It is anti-literal, relying on metaphor, allusion, and other rhetorical devices, and it assumes knowledge within a community of believers.
I'm going to write a book, continue acting, continue motivational speaking and just share with people who I am and what I've learned in my second chance of life and pass it on to people in their first chance of life.
Earl Nightingale has inspired more people toward success and fortune than any other motivational speaker on the planet.
People always accuse me of being motivational in a way, like it was a bad thing, but that's just how I was raised. My mom raised me in a positive environment, with lots of love in my heart, and that reflects in my music.
I'm a motivational speaker.
Courage is being scared to death, and saddling up anyway
I skate to where the puck is going to be, not where it has been
As long as you're going to be thinking anyway, think big.
If you build an Army of 100 Lions & their Leaders is a Dog, in any fight,the Lions will die like a Dog, but if you build an Army of 100 & Dogs their Leaders is a Lion, all Dogs will fight like a Lion
I am not afraid of an army of lions led by a sheep; I am afraid of an army of sheep led by a lion.
I am sometimes a fox and sometimes a lion. The whole secret of government lies in knowing when to be the one or the other.
Fear is not real. It is a product of thoughts you create. Do not misunderstand me. Danger is very real. But fear is a choice.
Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it.
Where you goin'? Nowhere. You're goin' nowhere!
You think anybody wants a roundhouse kick to the face while I'm wearing these bad boys?
May the wings of liberty never lose a feather.
Why worry? Each of us is wearing an unlicensed nuclear accelerator on his back.
I'm in a glass case of emotion!
I tend to think of myself as a one-man wolf pack.
Sometimes, the only choices you have are bad ones. But you still have to choose.
Old ladies die all the time. It's practically their job description.
Life's like a movie. Write your own ending.
The media's the most powerful entity on earth. They have the power to make the innocent guilty and to make the guilty innocent, and that's power. Because they control the minds of the masses.
Nobody can give you freedom. Nobody can give you equality or justice or anything. If you're a man, you take it.
Be peaceful, be courteous, obey the law, respect everyone; but if someone puts his hand on you, send him to the cemetery.
There is no better than adversity. Every defeat, every heartbreak, every loss, contains its own seed, its own lesson on how to improve your performance the next time.
I'm for truth, no matter who tells it. I'm for justice, no matter who it's for or against.
I am for violence if non-violence means we continue postponing a solution to the American black man's problem just to avoid violence.
The future belongs to those who prepare for it today.
Education is the passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs to those who prepare for it today.
I don't even call it violence when it's in self defense; I call it intelligence.
The American Negro never can be blamed for his racial animosities - he is only reacting to 400 years of the conscious racism of the American whites.
I believe in the brotherhood of man, all men, but I don't believe in brotherhood with anybody who doesn't want brotherhood with me. I believe in treating people right, but I'm not going to waste my time trying to treat somebody right who doesn't know how to return the treatment.
If you don't stand for something you will fall for anything.
America needs to understand Islam, because this is the one religion that erases from its society the race problem. Throughout my travels in the Muslim world, I have met, talked to, even eaten with people who in America would have been considered 'white,' but the 'white' attitude had been removed from their minds by the religion of Islam.
You can't separate peace from freedom because no one can be at peace unless he has his freedom.
America preaches integration and practices segregation.
No, we are not anti-white. But we don't have time for the white man. The white man is on top already, the white man is the boss already... He has first-class citizenship already. So you are wasting your time talking to the white man. We are working on our own people.
I have more respect for a man who lets me know where he stands, even if he's wrong. Than the one who comes up like an angel and is nothing but a devil.

A mind is like a parachute. It doesn't work if it is not open
People aren't against you; They are for themselves.
Climb the mountain not to plant your flag, but to embrace the challenge, enjoy the air and behold the view. Climb it so you can see the world, not so the world can see you
You learn more from failure then from success. Don't let it stop you. Failure builds character.
The most dangerous risk of all - The risk of spending your life not doing what you want on the bet you can buy yourself the freedom to do it later.
Go where you're celebrated, not where you're tolerated.
The person that you will spend the most time with in your life is yourself, so better try to make yourself as interesting as possible.
If you accept your limitations you go beyond them.
People often say that motivation doesn't last. Well, neither does bating. That's why we recommend it daily.
Everyone you meet is afraid of something, loves something and has lost something.
Comfort is the enemy of achievement.
You can't have a million-dollar dream with a minimum-wage work ethic.
When I was young, I observed that nine out of 10 things I did were failures. So I did 10 times more work.
If you have an idea of what you want to do in your future, you must go at it with almost monastic obsession, be it music, the ballet or just a basic degree. You have to go at it single-mindedly and let nothing get in your way.
Give your dreams all you've got and you'll be amazed at the energy that comes out of you.Give your dreams all you've got and you'll be amazed at the energy that comes out of you.
Many people think they want things, but they don't really have the strength, the discipline. They are weak. I believe that you get what you want if you want it badly enough.
Put your heart, mind, intellect and soul even to your smallest acts. This is the secret of success.
If a man is called a street sweeper, he should sweep streets even as Michelangelo painted, or Beethoven composed music, or Shakespeare wrote poetry. He should sweep streets so well that all the hosts of heaven and Earth will pause to say, 'Here lived a great street sweeper who did his job well.'
All life demands struggle. Those who have everything given to them become lazy, selfish and insensitive to the real values of life. The very striving and hard work that we so constantly try to avoid is the major building block in the person we are today.
Talent is cheaper than table salt. What separates the talented individual from the successful one is a lot of hard work.
God gives every bird its food, but He does not throw it into its nest.
Much good work is lost for the lack of a little more.
The person who is waiting for something to turn up might start with their shirt sleeves.
Those at the top of the mountain didn't fall there.
If you feel you are down on your luck, check the level of your effort.
You're either changing your life or you're not. No waiting for this or that or better weather or other hurdles. Hurdles are the change.
He who is outside his door has the hardest part of his journey behind him.
I do not know anyone who has got to the top without hard work. That is the recipe. It will not always get you to the top, but should get you pretty near.
The people who get on in this world are the people who get up and look for the circumstances they want, and, if they can't find them, make them.
Both liberty and among the primary goals pursued by human beings throughout many centuries; but total liberty for wolves is death to the lambs, total liberty of the powerful, the gifted, is not compatible with the rights to a decent existence of the weak and the less gifted. equality are.
Nothing is impossible, the word itself says "I'm possible"!

In every success story, you will find someone who has made a courageous decision.
We must train from the inside out. Using our strengths to attack and nullify any weaknesses. It's not about denying a weakness may exist but about denying its right to persist.
All of the great leaders have had one characteristic in common: it was the willingness to confront unequivocally the major anxiety of their people in their time. This, and not much else, is the essence of leadership.
My best advice to entrepreneurs is this: Forget about making mistakes, just do it.
Achievement seems to be connected with action. Successful men and women keep moving. They make mistakes but they don't quit.
Ambition is the steam that drives men forward on the road to success. Only the engine under full steam can make the grade.
Continuous learning is the minimum requirement for success in any field.
Everyone who achieves success in a great venture solved each problem as they came to it. They helped themselves and they were helped through powers known and unknown to them at the time they set out on their voyage. They kept going regardless of the obstacles they met.
Experience taught me a few things. One is to listen to your gut no matter how good something sounds on paper. The second is that you are generally better off sticking with what you know and the third is that sometimes, your best investments are the ones you don't make.
Failure isn't failure unless you don't learn from it.
Enthusiasm is the sparkle in your eyes, the swing in your gait, the grip of your hand and the irresistible surge of will and energy to execute your ideas.

The secret of joy in work is contained in one word: excellence. To know how to do something well is to enjoy it.
If you hear a voice within you saying 'you are not a painter' then by all means paint and that voice will be silenced.
You are to set your own value, communicate that value to the world, and then not settle for less. Sound daunting? That's just because it takes you out of your comfort zone. You have got to stop being an obstacle on your own path to wealth and security and happiness. You must understand that valuing yourself is well within your control.
The greatest discovery of my generation is that people can alter their lives by altering their attitudes.
Failure is just a resting place. It is an opportunity to begin again more intelligently.
The entrepreneur is essentially a visualizer and actualizer. He can visualize something, and when he visualizes it he sees exactly how to make it happen.
Believe you can and you're halfway there.
To handle yourself, use your head; to handle others, use your heart.
Too many of us are not living our dreams because we are living our fears.
Whatever the mind of man can conceive and believe, it can achieve.
Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn't do than by the ones you did do, so throw off the bowlines, sail away from safe harbor, catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore, Dream, Discover.
I've missed more than 9000 shots in my career. I've lost almost 300 games. 26 times I've been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed. I've failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed.

Happiness is the real sense of fulfillment that comes from hard work.

Many people think they want things, but they don't really have the strength, the discipline. They are weak. I believe that you get what you want if you want it badly enough.

If a man is called a street sweeper, he should sweep streets even as Michelangelo painted, or Beethoven composed music, or Shakespeare wrote poetry. He should sweep streets so well that all the hosts of heaven and Earth will pause to say, 'Here lived a great street sweeper who did his job well.'
All life demands struggle. Those who have everything given to them become lazy, selfish and insensitive to the real values of life. The very striving and hard work that we so constantly try to avoid is the major building block in the person we are today.

I do not know anyone who has got to the top without hard work. That is the recipe. It will not always get you to the top, but should get you pretty near.

A person who does not want to be struck by the enemy's arrows will have no divine protection.
The Doctor: You just want cruelty to beget cruelty. You're not superior to people who were cruel to you. You're just a whole bunch of new cruel people. A whole bunch of new cruel people, being cruel to some other people, who'll end up being cruel to you. The only way anyone can live in peace is if they're prepared to forgive. Why don't you break the cycle?  Bonnie: Why should we?  The Doctor: What is it that you actually want?  Bonnie: War.  The Doctor: Ah. And when this war is over, when -- when you have the homeland free from humans, what do you think it's going to be like? Do you know? Have you thought about it? Have you given it any consideration? Because you're very close to getting what you want. What's it going to be like? Paint me a picture. Are you going to live in houses? Do you want people to go to work? What'll be holidays? Oh! Will there be music? Do you think people will be allowed to play violins? Who will make the violins? Well? Oh, You don't actually know, do you? Because, just like every other tantruming child in history, Bonnie, you don't actually know what you want. So, let me ask you a question about this brave new world of yours. When you've killed all the bad guys, and it's all perfect and just and fair, when you have finally got it exactly the way you want it, what are you going to do with the people like you? The troublemakers. How are you going to protect your glorious revolution from the next one?  Bonnie: We'll win.  Doctor: Oh, will you? Well maybe -- maybe you will win. But nobody wins for long. The wheel just keeps turning. So, come on. Break the cycle.  Bonnie: Then why are you still talking?  The Doctor: Because I'm trying to get you to see. And I'm almost there.  Bonnie: Do you know what I see, Doctor? A box. A box with everything I need. A 50% chance.  Kate: For us, too.  [The Doctor sighs.]  The Doctor: And we're off! Fingers on buzzers! Are you feeling lucky? Are you ready to play the game? Who's going to be quickest? Who's going to be the luckiest?  Kate: This is not a game!  The Doctor: No, it's not a game, sweetheart, and I mean that most sincerely.  Bonnie: Why are you doing this?  Kate: Yes, I'd like to know that too. You set this up -- why?  The Doctor: Because it's not a game, Kate. This is a scale model of war. Every war ever fought right there in front of you. Because it's always the same. When you fire that first shot, no matter how right you feel, you have no idea who's going to die. You don't know who's children are going to scream and burn. How many hearts will be broken! How many lives shattered! How much blood will spill until everybody does what they're always going to have to do from the very beginning -- sit down and talk! Listen to me, listen. I just -- I just want you to think. Do you know what thinking is? It's just a fancy word for changing your mind.  Bonnie: I will not change my mind.  The Doctor: Then you will die stupid. Alternatively, you could step away from that box. You could walk right out of that door, and you could stand your revolution down.  Bonnie: No, I'm not stopping this, Doctor. I started it. I will not stop it. You think they'll let me go after what I've done?  The Doctor: You're all the same, you screaming kids, you know that? "Look at me, I'm unforgivable." Well here's the unforeseeable, I forgive you. After all you've done. I forgive you.  Bonnie: You don't understand. You will never understand.  The Doctor: I don't understand? Are you kidding? Me? Of course I understand. I mean, do you call this a war, this funny little thing? This is not a war. I fought in a bigger war than you will ever know. I did worse things than you could ever imagine, and when I close my eyes... I hear more screams than anyone could ever be able to count! And do you know what you do with all that pain? Shall I tell you where you put it? You hold it tight... Til it burns your hand. And you say this -- no one else will ever have to live like this. No one else will ever have to feel this pain. Not on my watch.  [Kate closes her box.]  The Doctor: Thank you. Thank you.  Kate: I'm sorry.  The Doctor: I know. I know, thank you.  [The Doctor looks back to Bonnie.]  Well?  Bonnie: It's empty, isn't it? Both boxes -- there's nothing in them. Just buttons.  The Doctor: Of course. But you know how you know that? Because you've started to think like me. It's hell, isn't it? No one should have to think like that. And no one will. Not on our watch.  [The Doctor and Bonnie stare at one another for a moment.]  The Doctor: Gotcha.  Bonnie: How can you be so sure?  The Doctor: Because you have a disadvantage, Zygella. I know that face.  Kate: Well, this is all very well, but as know the boxes are empty now. We can't forget that.  The Doctor: No, well, uh... You've said that the last 15 times.  [The Doctor uses his sunglasses, which begin pulsing.]  Bonnie: You didn't wipe my memory.  The Doctor: No. Just Kate's. Oh, and your little friends here, of course. When they wake up, they won't remember what you've done. It'll be our secret.  Bonnie: You're going to protect me?  Osgood: Well, you're one of us now, whether you like it or not.  Bonnie: I don't understand how You could just forgive me.  The Doctor: Because I've been where you have. There was another box. I was gonna press another button. I was going to wipe out all of my own kind. Man, woman, and child. I was so sure I was right.  Bonnie: What happened?  The Doctor: Same thing that happened to you. I let Clara Oswald get inside my head.  [The Doctor looks at Clara.]  The Doctor: Trust me... She doesn't leave.

Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever.
There is more to life than increasing its speed.
Power is of two kinds. One is obtained by the fear of punishment and the other by acts of love. Power based on love is a thousand times more effective and permanent then the one derived from fear of punishment.
Strength does not come from physical capacity. It comes from an indomitable will.
When you're good at something, you'll tell everyone. When you're great at something, they'll tell you.
Your talent determines what you can do. Your motivation determines how much you are willing to do. Your attitude determines how well you do it.
The difference between a successful person and others is not a lack of strength, not a lack of knowledge -- but rather in a lack of will.
Setting a goal is not the main thing. It is deciding how you will go about achieving it and staying with that plan.
Nobody who ever gave his best regretted it.
There are only three things you should ever do about a mistake: Admit it, learn from it, don't repeat it.
Talent sets the floor, character sets the ceiling.
Winning is what happens when commitment, desire, talent, preparation, hard work and leadership all come together.
Humble enough to prepare, confident enough to perform.
If you can believe it, the mind can achieve it.
Leadership is a matter of having people look at you and gain confidence. If you're in control, they're in control.
The quality of a person's life is in direct proportion to their commitment to excellence, regardless of their chosen field of endeavor.
If football taught me anything about business, it is that you win the game one play at a time.
Today I will do what others won't, so tomorrow I can accomplish what others can't.
Self-praise is for losers. Be a winner. Stand for something. Always have class, and be humble.
You are never a loser until you quit trying.
Adversity is an opportunity for heroism.
The difference between ordinary and extraordinary is that little extra.
Always be yourself, express yourself, have faith in yourself, do not go out and look for a successful personality and duplicate it.
Mistakes are always forgivable, if one has the courage to admit them.
If you love life, don't waste time, for time is what life is made up of.
Notice that the stiffest tree is most easily cracked, while the bamboo or willow survives by bending with the wind.
A quick temper will make a fool of you soon enough.
Showing off is the fool's idea of glory.
I fear not the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks once, but I fear the man who has practiced one kick 10,000 times.
Real living is living for others.
Love is like a friendship caught on fire. In the beginning a flame, very pretty, often hot and fierce, but still only light and flickering. As love grows older, our hearts mature and our love becomes as coals, deep-burning and unquenchable.
As you think, so shall you become.
Demons run when a good man goes to war Night will fall and drown the sun When a good man goes to war  Friendship dies and true love lies Night will fall and the dark will rise When a good man goes to war  Demons run, but count the cost The battle's won, but the child is lost
People assume that time is a strict progression of cause to effect, but *actually* from a non-linear, non-subjective viewpoint - it's more like a big ball of wibbly wobbly... time-y wimey... stuff.
You want weapons? We're in a library. Books are the best weapon in the world. This room's the greatest arsenal we could have. Arm yourself!
There's something that doesn't make sense. Let's go and poke it with a stick.
Through crimson stars and silent stars and tumbling nebulas like oceans set on fire; through empires of glass and civilizations of pure thought, and a whole, terrible, wonderful universe of impossibilities. You see these eyes? They're old eyes. And one thing I can tell you, Alex... Monsters are real.
And if anyone happens to ask whether I made any material difference to the welfare of this planet, you can tell them I came and went like a summer cloud.
It's like when you're a kid. The first time they tell you that the world's turning and you just can't quite believe it 'cause everything looks like it's standing still... I can feel it: the turn of the Earth. The ground beneath our feet is spinning at 1,000 miles an hour and the entire planet is hurtling around the sun at 67,000 miles an hour, and I can feel it. We're falling through space, you and me, clinging to the skin of this tiny little world, and if we let go... That's who I am
When you wake up... I'll be a story in your head. But that's okay. We're all stories, in the end... just make it a good one, eh? Because it was. It was the best.
There are worlds out there where the sky is burning, and the sea's asleep, and the rivers dream; people made of smoke and cities made of song. Somewhere there's danger, somewhere there's injustice, and somewhere else the tea's getting cold. Come on, Ace. We've got work to do.
I'm a Time Lord... you don't understand the implications. I'm not a human being; I walk in eternity.
We all change, when you think about it. We're all different people all through our lives. And that's okay, that's good, you've got to keep moving, so long as you remember all the people that you used to be. I will not forget one line of this. Not one day. I swear. I will always remember when the Doctor was me.
Have you ever thought what it's like to be wanderers in the Fourth Dimension? Have you? To be exiles? Susan and I are cut off from our own planet - without friends or protection. But one day we shall get back. Yes, one day.
The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things. The good things don't always soften the bad things, but vice versa, the bad things don't always spoil the good things and make them unimportant.
Good, better, best. Never let it rest. 'Til your good is better and your better is best.
In order to succeed, we must first believe that we can.
Failure will never overtake me if my determination to succeed is strong enough.
Life is 10% what happens to you and 90% how you react to it.
On Tactics level you are right, but on strategy level you are completely wrong
If I didn't take people where they hired me to take them, I wouldn't expect them to get back on my bus. We expect leaders to take us where we want to go. The problem, it seems to me, begins when they don't. When things do not improve and yet these leaders keep expecting us to get on their bus, I think this is when leaders become something else. Politicians.
Like sewage, smartphones, and Donald Trump, some things are just inevitable.
The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things. The good things don't always soften the bad things, but vice versa, the bad things don't always spoil the good things and make them unimportant.
Do what I do. Hold tight and pretend it's a plan!
In 900 years of time and space, I've never met anyone who wasn't important
We're all stories, in the end. Just make it a good one, eh?
Letting it get to you. You know what that's called? Being alive. Best thing there is. Being alive right now is all that counts.
You don't just give up. You don't just let things happen. You make a stand! You say no! You have the guts to do what's right, even when everyone else just runs away.
People assume that time is a strict progression of cause to effect, but *actually* from a non-linear, non-subjective viewpoint - it's more like a big ball of wibbly wobbly... time-y wimey... stuff
There's something that doesn't make sense. Let's go and poke it with a stick.
You know, the very powerful and the very stupid have one thing in common: they don't alter their views to fit the facts; they alter the facts to fit their views.
if you wanted to do something absolutely honest, something true, it always turned out to be a thing that had to be done alone.
We believe in ordinary acts of bravery, in the courage that drives one person to stand up for another.
Don't think or judge, just listen.
One day, in retrospect, the years of struggle will strike you as the most beautiful.
Don't be afraid of your fears. They're not there to scare you. They're there to let you know that something is worth it.
You will find that it is necessary to let things go; simply for the reason that they are heavy. So let them go, let go of them. I tie no weights to my ankles.
Thinking something does not make it true. Wanting something does not make it real.
No matter what happens, or how bad it seems today, life does go on, and it will be better tomorrow.
The unhappiest people in this world, are those who care the most about what other people think.
Attitude is a choice. Happiness is a choice. Optimism is a choice. Kindness is a choice. Giving is a choice. Respect is a choice. Whatever choice you make makes you. Choose wisely.
If you want to be happy, do not dwell in the past, do not worry about the future, focus on living fully in the present.
Respect other people's feelings. It might mean nothing to you, but it could mean everything to them.
Don't be pushed around by the fears in your mind. Be led by the dreams in your heart.
Instead of worrying about what you cannot control, shift your energy to what you can create.
It's only after you've stepped outside your comfort zone that you begin to change, grow, and transform.
More smiling, less worrying. More compassion, less judgment. More blessed, less stressed. More love, less hate.
Acts of Kindness: A random act of kindness, no matter how small, can make a tremendous impact on someone else's life.
Live the Life of Your Dreams: Be brave enough to live the life of your dreams according to your vision and purpose instead of the expectations and opinions of others.
Be grateful for what you already have while you pursue your goals. If you aren't grateful for what you already have, what makes you think you would be happy with more.
Do what is right, not what is easy nor what is popular.
No amount of regretting can change the past, and no amount of worrying can change the future.
When someone loves you, the way they talk about you is different. You feel safe and comfortable.
I no longer believed in the idea of soul mates, or love at first sight. But I was beginning to believe that a very few times in your life, if you were lucky, you might meet someone who was exactly right for you. Not because he was perfect, or because you were, but because your combined flaws were arranged in a way that allowed two separate beings to hinge together.
Indifference and neglect often do much more damage than outright dislike.
The meeting of two personalities is like the contact of two chemical substances: if there is any reaction, both are transformed.
A guy and a girl can be just friends, but at one point or another, they will fall for each other...Maybe temporarily, maybe at the wrong time, maybe too late, or maybe forever
For the two of us, home isn't a place. It is a person. And we are finally home.
Man may have discovered fire, but women discovered how to play with it.
I mean, if the relationship can't survive the long term, why on earth would it be worth my time and energy for the short term?
When you stop expecting people to be perfect, you can like them for who they are.
I can't give you a sure-fire formula for success, but I can give you a formula for failure: try to please everybody all the time.
If at first you don't succeed, try, try again. Then quit. No use being a damn fool about it.
Try not to become a man of success. Rather become a man of value.
We should always be asking ourselves: "Is this something that is, or is not, in my control?"
Whatever happens to you has been waiting to happen since the beginning of time. The twining strands of fate wove both of them together.
We suffer more in imagination than in reality.
It is impossible for a man to learn what he thinks he already knows.
The things you think about determine the quality of your mind.
Waste no more time arguing what a good man should be. Be one.
It is the power of the mind to be unconquerable.
Seek not for events to happen as you wish but rather wish for events to happen as they do and your life will go smoothly.
The first rule is to keep an untroubled spirit. The second is to look things in the face and know them for what they are.
Keep silence for the most part, and speak only when you must, and then briefly.
While we are postponing, life speeds by.
How much more grievous are the consequences of anger than the causes of it.
Is freedom anything else than the right to live as we wish? Nothing else.
A gem cannot be polished without friction, nor a man perfected without trials.
It is not death that a man should fear, but he should fear never beginning to live.
Planning to retire? Before you do find your hidden passion, do the thing that you have always wanted to do.
You don't stop laughing when you grow old, you grow old when you stop laughing.
Don't act your age in retirement. Act like the inner young person you have always been.
Retirement is supposed to be the great escape from the stresses inherent in most jobs, a time to experience a fulfilling life derived from many enjoyable and rewarding activities.
A man is not old until regrets take the place of dreams.
Stay young at heart, kind in spirit, and enjoy retirement living.
Once the mindless myths associated with aging are dispelled, people of traditional retirement age must learn to identify the purpose they can pursue with a passion.
The harder you work, the harder it is to surrender.
The question isn't at what age I want to retire, it's at what income.
The trouble with retirement is that you never get a day off.
Rest is not idleness, and to lie sometimes on the grass under trees on a summer's day, listening to the murmur of the water, or watching the clouds float across the sky, is by no means a waste of time.
I'm very pleased to be here. Let's face it, at my age I'm very pleased to be anywhere.
Choose a work that you love and you won't have to work another day.
When a man retires, his wife gets twice the husband but only half the income.
Often when you think you're at the end of something, you're at the beginning of something else.
Don't simply retire from something; have something to retire to.
There is a whole new kind of life ahead, full of experiences just waiting to happen. Some call it "retirement." I call it bliss.
A gold watch is the most appropriate gift for retirement, as its recipients have given up so many of their golden hours in a lifetime of service.
Sooner or later I'm going to die, but I'm not going to retire.
Please remember that retirement is a different way of life, with new challenges and opportunities. You need to adapt and adjust to this new lifestyle, and that takes time, effort, and creativity.
As in all successful ventures, the foundation of a good retirement is planning.
You are never too old to set a new goal or dream a new dream.
Retirement does not mean that you are all through. It means that you have experienced a big break-through to a new freedom, with the time to do the things you've always wanted to do.
Today we are living longer and retiring earlier, allowing us twenty-five or more years to pursue lifelong goals and passions. Rather than fading into the sunset, we have time to rediscover our personal uniqueness, deepen relationships, and question the mysteries of life.
Preparation for old age should begin not later than one's teens. A life which is empty of purpose until 65 will not suddenly become filled on retirement.
Retire from work, but not from life.
Age is only a number, a cipher for the records. A man can't retire his experience. He must use it. Experience achieves more with less energy and time.
Those who think they have no time for bodily exercise will sooner or later have to find time for illness.
At age 20, we worry about what others think of us. At age 40, we don't care what they think of us. At age 60, we discover they haven't been thinking of us at all.
Retirement is wonderful. It's doing nothing without worrying about getting caught at it.
There is no need for the writer to eat a whole sheep to be able to tell what mutton tastes like.
My writing is full of lives I might have led. A writer imagines what could have happened, not what really happened.
How vain it is to sit down to write when you have not stood up to live.
A writer need not devour a whole sheep in order to know what mutton tastes like, but he must at least eat a chop. Unless he gets his facts right, his imagination will lead him into all kinds of nonsense, and the facts he is most likely to get right are the facts of his own experience.
I write with experiences in mind, but I don't write about them, I write out of them.
Books always Fiction-generalspeak of other books, and every story tells a story that has already been told.
Books are for nothing but to inspire.
It had been startling and disappointing to me to find out that story books had been written by people, that books were not natural wonders, coming up of themselves like grass.
...books should be like a prime rib steak - good and thick.
The sacred-souls of authors are displayed in the beauty of their books.
Professional Book Editor: Having your novel, short story or nonfiction manuscript proofread or edited before submitting it can prove invaluable. In an economic climate where you face heavy competition, your writing needs a second eye to give you the edge. Whether you come from a big city like Portland, Oregon, or a small town like Papa, Hawaii, I can provide that second eye.
The Universe speaks in many languages but only one voice. A language which is not Narn or Human or Centauri or Gaim or Minbari. It speaks in the language of hope.  It speaks in the language of trust. It speaks in the language of strength and the language of compassion. It is the language of the heart and of the language of the soul; but always it is the same voice; it is the voice of our ancestors speaking through us, and the voice of our inheritors waiting to be born; it is the small still voice that says: "We are one." No matter the blood, no matter the skin, no matter the world, no matter the star. We are one. No matter the pain, no matter the darkness, no matter the loss, no matter the fear. We are one. Here, gathered together in common cause we agree to recognize this singular truth and this singular rule: that we must be kind to one another.  Because each voice enriches us and ennobles us, and each voice lost diminishes us. We are the voice of the universe, the soul of creation, the fire that will light the way to a better future.  We are one.  We are one.

Men occasionally stumble over the truth, but most of them pick themselves up and hurry off as if nothing had happened.
Loyal customers, they don't just come back, they don't simply recommend you, they insist that their friends do business with you.
In the world of Internet customer service, it's important to remember your competitor is only one mouse click away.
Kind words can be short and easy to speak, but their echoes are truly endless.
Customer service represents the heart of a brand in the hearts of its customers.
Quality is remembered long after the price is forgotten.
Customer service shouldn't just be a department, it should be the entire company.    Tony Hsieh
There is a big difference between a satisfied customer and a loyal customer. Never settle for 'satisfied'.
It is not the employer who pays the wages. Employers only handle the money. It is the customer who pays the wages.
Although your customers won't love you if you give bad service, your competitors will.
Courteous treatment will make a customer a walking advertisement.
It's not enough to have lived. We should be determined to live for something.
The path to our destination is not always a straight one. We go down the wrong road, we get lost, we turn back. Maybe it doesn't matter which road we embark on. Maybe what matters is that we embark.
People take different roads seeking fulfillment and happiness. Just because they're not on your road doesn't mean they've gotten lost.
The heart of human excellence often begins to beat when you discover a pursuit that absorbs you, frees you, challenges you, or gives you a sense of meaning, joy, or passion.
Definiteness of purpose is the starting point of all achievement.
To begin to think with purpose, is to enter the ranks of those strong ones who only recognize failure as one of the pathways to attainment.
The mystery of human existence lies not in just staying alive, but in finding something to live for.
The soul which has no fixed purpose in life is lost; to be everywhere, is to be nowhere.

Alice: How long is forever? White Rabbit: Sometimes, just one second.
Sometimes the most productive thing you can do is relax.
Almost everything will work again if you unplug it for a few minutes... Including you.
Of all the things that matter, that really and truly matter, working more efficiently and getting more done, is not one of them.
The key is not to prioritize what's on your schedule, but to schedule your priorities.
You can do anything-but not everything.
Our anxiety does not come from thinking about the future, but from wanting to control it.
Do not anticipate trouble or worry about what may never happen. Keep in the sunlight.
Somehow our devils are never quite what we expect when we meet them face to face.
It's not stress that kills us, it is our reaction to it.
It's a good idea always to do something relaxing prior to making an important decision in your life.
The greatest mistake you can make in life is to be continually fearing you will make one.
It is impossible to live without failing at something, unless you live so cautiously that you might as well not have lived at all - in which case, you fail by default.
Stress is the trash of modern life; we all generate it, but if you don't dispose of it properly, it will pile up and overtake your life.
We can easily manage if we will only take, each day, the burden appointed to it. But the load will be too heavy for us if we carry yesterday's burden over again today, and then add the burden of the morrow before we are required to bear it.
Today expect something good to happen to you no matter what occurred yesterday. Realize the past no longer holds you captive. It can only continue to hurt you if you hold on to it.
When one door closes another door opens; but we so often look so long and so regretfully upon the closed door, that we do not see the ones which open for us.
Do not listen with the intent to reply. But listen with the intent to understand.
Choose to love each other even in those moments when you struggle to like each other. Love is a commitment, not a feeling.
Nothing can bring you peace but yourself.
A good way to overcome stress is to help others out of theirs.
In times of stress, the best thing we can do for each other is to listen with our ears and our hearts and to be assured that our questions are just as important as our answers.

Alice laughed. 'There's no use trying,' she said. 'One can't believe impossible things.'  I daresay you haven't had much practice,' said the Queen. 'When I was your age, I always did it for half-an-hour a day. Why, sometimes I've believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast. There goes the shawl again!

Throw me to the wolves and I will return leading the pack.
They lose the day in expectation of the night, and the night in fear of the dawn.
Every night before going to sleep, we must ask ourselves: what weakness did I overcome today? What virtue did I acquire?
Difficulties strengthen the mind, as labor does the body.
We are always complaining that our days are few, and acting as though there would be no end of them.

Only barbarians are not curious about where they come from, how they came to be where they are, where they appear to be going, whether they wish to go there, and if so, why, and if not, why not.
Science cannot destroy the consciousness of freedom, without which there is no morality and no art, but it can refute it.
The notion of the perfect whole, the ultimate solution in which all good things coexist, seems to me not merely unobtainable--that is a truism--but conceptually incoherent. ......Some among the great goods cannot live together. That is a conceptual truth. We are doomed to choose, and every choice may entail an irreparable loss.
All central beliefs on human matters spring from a personal predicament.
If you are truly convinced that there is some solution to all human problems, that one can conceive an ideal society which men can reach if only they do what is necessary to attain it, then you and your followers must believe that no price can be too high to pay in order to open the gates of such a paradise. Only the stupid and malevolent will resist once certain simple truths are put to them. Those who resist must be persuaded; if they cannot be persuaded, laws must be passed to restrain them; if that does not work, then coercion, if need be violence, will inevitably have to be used—if necessary, terror, slaughter.
Out of the crooked timber of humanity, nothing completely straight was ever made
[People] cannot live without seeking to describe and explain the universe to themselves. The models they use in doing this must deeply affect their lives, not least when they are unconscious; much of [their] misery and frustration... is due to the mechanical and unconscious, as well as deliberate, application of models where they do not work…The goal of philosophy is always the same, to assist [people] to understand themselves and thus operate in the open and not wildly, in the dark.

A man with outward courage dares to die; a man with inner courage dares to live.
Do you have the patience to wait until your mud settles and the water is clear?
If you understand others you are smart. If you understand yourself you are illuminated. If you overcome others you are powerful. If you overcome yourself you have strength. If you know how to be satisfied you are rich. If you can act with vigor, you have a will. If you don't lose your objectives you can be long-lasting. If you die without loss, you are eternal.

If you try to change it, you will ruin it. Try to hold it, and you will lose it.
Stop thinking, and end your problems. What difference between yes and no? What difference between success and failure? Must you value what others value, avoid what others avoid? How ridiculous!  Other people are excited, as though they were at a parade. I alone don't care, I alone am expressionless, like an infant before it can smile.  Other people have what they need; I alone possess nothing. I alone drift about, like someone without a home. I am like an idiot, my mind is so empty.  Other people are bright; I alone am dark. Other people are sharp; I alone am dull. Other people have purpose; I alone don't know. I drift like a wave on the ocean, I blow as aimless as the wind.  I am different from ordinary people. I drink from the Great Mother's breasts.

all streams flow to the sea because it is lower than they are. humility gives it its power. if you want to govern the people, you must place yourself below them. if you want to lead the people, you must learn how to follow them.

Qui-Gon's defiance I sense in you. Need that you do not. Agree with you, the Council does. Your apprentice young Skywalker will be.
Lost a planet, Master Obi-Wan has. How embarrassing... how embarrassing.
Go to the center of the gravity's pull, and find your planet you will.
Meditate on this, I will.
Clear, your mind must be if you are to discover the real villains behind the plot.
Pain. Suffering. Death, I feel. Something terrible has happened. Young Skywalker is in pain. Terrible pain.
Around the survivors, a perimeter create!
Powerful you have become, Dooku. The dark side I sense in you.
Master Obi-Wan, not victory. The shroud of the dark side has fallen. Begun, the Clone War has!
Much to learn, you still have.
Like fire across the galaxy, the Clone Wars spread. In league with the wicked Count Dooku more and more planets slip. Upon the Jedi Knights falls the duty to lead the newly formed Army of the Republic.
Death is a natural part of life. Rejoice for those who transform into the Force. Mourn them do not. Miss them do not. Attachment leads to jealousy. The shadow of greed, that is.
Careful you must be when sensing the future. The fear of loss is a path to the dark side.
Train yourself to let go of everything you fear to lose.
Go, I will. Good relations with the Wookiees, I have.
Too much under the sway of the Chancellor, he is. Much anger there is in him. Too much pride in his powers.
If into the security recordings you go, only pain will you find.
Destroy the Sith, we must.
To fight this Lord Sidious, strong enough, you are not.
Twisted by the dark side, young Skywalker has become.
The boy you trained, gone he is, consumed by Darth Vader.
I hear a new apprentice you have, Emperor. Or should I call you Darth Sidious?
At an end your rule is... and not short enough it was.
Not if anything to say about it, I have!
Into exile I must go. Failed, I have.
If so powerful you are, why leave?
Faith in your new apprentice, misplaced may be. As is your faith in the dark side of the Force.
Looking? Found someone you have I would say, mm?
Help you I can! Yes! Mm!
Awww, cannot get your ship out...eh-heheheh!
How you get so big, eating food of this kind?
Mine! Or I will help you not!
Mudhole? Slimy? My home this is!
I cannot teach him. The boy has no patience.
Hmm. Much anger in him, like his father.
You will be. You will be.
Yes. A Jedi's strength flows from the Force. But beware the dark side. Anger, fear, aggression. The dark side of the Force are they. Easily they flow, quick to join you in a fight. If once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny. Consume you it will, as it did Obi-Wan's apprentice.
You will know... when you are calm, at peace, passive. A Jedi uses the Force for knowledge and defense, never for attack.
So certain are you. Always with you it cannot be done. Hear you nothing that I say?
No! No different! Only different in your mind. You must unlearn what you have learned.
That is why you fail.
No! Try not. Do. Or do not. There is no try.
Size matters not. Look at me. Judge me by my size do you?
And well you should not! For my ally is the Force. And a powerful ally it is. Life creates it, makes it grow. Its energy surrounds us... and binds us. Luminous beings are we, not this... crude matter! You must feel the Force around you. Here, between you, me, the tree, the rock... everywhere! Even between the land and the ship.
Through the Force, things you will see. Other places. The future...the past...old friends long gone.
Hmm. Control, control. You must learn control.
Difficult to see. Always in motion is the future.
Decide you must how to serve them best. If you leave now, help them you could. But you would destroy all for which they have fought and suffered.
Mind what you have learned. Save you it can!
No. There is another.
When nine hundred years old you reach, look as good, you will not, hm?
Strong am I with the Force, but not that strong. Twilight is upon me, and soon night must fall. That is the way of things... the way of the Force.
No more training do you require. Already know you that which you need.
No. Unfortunate that you rushed to face him... that incomplete was your training. Not ready for the burden were you.
Remember, a Jedi's strength flows from the Force. But beware. Anger, fear, aggression. The dark side are they. Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny.
Your father he is.
Do not underestimate the powers of the Emperor, or suffer your father's fate, you will.
When gone am I, the last of the Jedi will you be.
Pity your new disciple I do; so lately an apprentice, so soon without a Master.
War does not make one great.
Proud I am, to stand by Wookiees in their hour of need.
Yoda I am, fight I will.
Tired I am, rest I must.
When all choices seem wrong, choose restraint.
If no mistake have you made, yet losing you are ... a different game you should play.
A trial of being old is this: remembering which thing one has said into which young ears.
Think you I have never felt the touch of the dark? Know you what a soul so great as Yoda can make, in eight hundred years?
Think you the relationship between Master and Padawan is only to help them? Oh, this is what we let them believe, yes! But when the day comes that even old Yoda does not learn something from his students-then truly, he shall be a teacher no more.
On many long journeys have I gone. And waited, too, for others to return from journeys of their own. Some return; some are broken; some come back so different only their names remain.
Honor life by living, Padawan. Killing honors only death: only the dark side.
To be Jedi is to face the truth, and choose. Give off light, or darkness, Padawan. Be a candle, or the night, Padawan: but choose!
When you look at the dark side, careful you must be ... for the dark side looks back.
You think Yoda stops teaching, just because his student does not want to hear? Yoda a teacher is. Yoda teaches like drunkards drink. Like killers kill.
A labyrinth of evil, this war has become.
To the Force, look for guidance. Accept what fate has placed before us.
My ally is the Force.

Every form of addiction is bad, no matter whether the narcotic be alcohol or morphine or idealism.
Addictions started out like magical pets, pocket monsters. They did extraordinary tricks, showed you things you hadn't seen, were fun. But came, through some gradual dire alchemy, to make decisions for you. Eventually, they were making your most crucial life decisions. And they were less intelligent than goldfish.
What fascinates me about addiction and obsessive behavior is that people would choose an altered state of consciousness that's toxic and ostensibly destroys most aspects of your normal life, because for brief moment you feel okay.
Quitting smoking is easy, I've done it hundreds of times.
Addiction begins with the hope that something out there can instantly fill up the emptiness inside.
Addiction is just way of trying to get at something else. Something bigger. Call it transcendence if you want, but it's like rat in maze. We all want the same thing. We all have this hole. The thing you want offers relief, but it's trap.
At first, addiction is maintained by pleasure, but the intensity of this pleasure gradually diminishes and the addiction is then maintained by the avoidance of pain.
At every stage, addiction is driven by one of the most powerful, mysterious, and vital forces of human existence. What drives addiction is longing longing not just of brain, belly, or loins but finally of the heart.
The mentality and behavior of drug addicts and alcoholics is wholly irrational until you understand that they are completely powerless over their addiction and unless they have structured help, they have no hope.

You know you're an alcoholic when you misplace things for like decade.
admire addicts. In world where everybody is waiting for some blind, random disaster, or some sudden disease, the addict has the comfort of knowing what will most likely wait for him down the road.

Drugs have taught an entire generation of American kids the metric system.
The initial journey towards sobriety is delicate balance between insight into one's desire for escape and abstinence from one's addiction.

What is addiction, really It is sign, signal, symptom of distress. It is language that tells us about plight that must be understood.
Addiction doesn't kill the addict. It kills the family, kids and people who tried to help.
If you know someone who tries to drown their sorrows, you might tell them sorrows know how to swim.
First you take drink, then the drink takes drink, then the drink takes you.
The first thing in the human personality that dissolves in alcohol is dignity.
All the suffering, stress and addiction comes from not realizing you already are what you are looking for.
Habit is habit, and not to be flung out of the window by any man, but coaxed downstairs step at time.
The dead drug leaves ghost behind. At certain hours it haunts the house.
Addiction When you can give up something any time, as long as it's next Tuesday.
The unfortunate thing about this world is that good habits are so much easier to give up than bad ones.
Reality is just crutch for people who can't handle drugs.
Recovery from addiction requires hard work, proper attitude and learning skills to stay sober, not drinking alcohol or using other drugs. Successful drug recovery or alcohol recovery involves changing attitudes, acquiring knowledge, and developing skills to meet the many challenges of sobriety.
Addiction is symptom of not growing up.

The thermometer of success is merely the jealousy of the malcontents.

I've spent most of my life walking under that hovering cloud, jealousy, whose acid raindrops blurred my vision and burned holes in my heart. Once learned to use the umbrella of confidence, the skies cleared up for me and the sunshine called joy became my faithful companion.
Jealousy is the tribute mediocrity pays to genius.
To cure jealousy is to see it for what it is, dissatisfaction with self.
Love sees sharply, hatred sees even more sharp, but Jealousy sees the sharpest for it is love and hate at the same time.
Never waste jealousy on real man it is the imaginary man that supplants us all in the long run.
Jealousy is simply and clearly the fear that you do not have value. Jealousy scans for evidence to prove the point that others will be preferred and rewarded more than you. There is only one alternative self value. If you cannot love yourself, you will not believe that you are loved. You will always think it's mistake or luck. Take your eyes off others and turn the scanner within. Find the seeds of your jealousy, clear the old voices and experiences. Put all the energy into building your personal and emotional security.

This civil dissension in the mind, like that of the body politic, commits great disorders, and lays all waste. Nothing stands safe in its way Nature, interest, religion, must yield to its fury. It violates contracts, dissolves society, breaks wedlock, betrays friends and neighbours. No body is good, and every one is either doing or designing them mischief. It has venom that more or less rankles wherever it bites And as it reports fancies or facts, so it disturbs its own house as often as other folks.
Surrounded by the flames of jealousy, the jealous one winds up, like the scorpion, turning the poisoned sting against himself.
Envy. since it lodgement is in the heart, not the brain, no degree of intellect supplies guarantee against it.

This thing that men call justice, this blind snake that strikes men down in the dark, mindless with fury, keep your hand back from it, pass by in silence.

To become power for peace, man must first pass through experiences which lead him to see things in their different aspects it is necessary that he have wide horizon, and breathe various atmospheres in word, from crossing, one after another, paths and points of view the most diverse, and sometimes the most contradictory, he must acquire the faculty of putting himself in the place of others and appreciating them.
The need for justice grows out of the conflict of human interests. That is to say, if there were no conflict of interests among mankind we should never have invented the word justice, nor conceived the idea for which it stands.
Justice is always violent to the party offending, for every man is innocent in his own eyes.
Justice is the tolerable accommodation of the conflicting interests of society, and don't believe there is any royal road to attain such accommodation concretely.

Contrary to popular misconception, karma has nothing to do with punishment and reward. It exists as part of our holographic universe's binary or dualistic operating system only to teach us responsibility for our creations and all things we experience are our creations.
Karma moves in two directions. If we act virtuously, the seed we plant will result in happiness. If we act non virtuously, suffering results.
As she has planted, so does she harvest such is the field of karma.
Karma is justice. It does not reward or punish. It shows no favoritism because we all have to earn all that we receive. Karma doesn predestine anything. We create our own causes and Karma adjusts the effects with perfect balance.

Revenge will never solve anything, karma will.
What goes around comes back around.
Do good and good will follow you.
Great Karma additionally interprets into great well being. At the point when an individual has cheerful and delighted viewpoint in life, this will just add to the wellbeing of his or her wellbeing condition.
The results of karma, whether good or bad, may not manifest right away. In may happen in the same lifetime or in future life. We may even receive both positive and negative reactions at the same time.
Karma is intertwined in the fabric of our life, and training ourselves to be aware of this can transform how we live. We become more mindful and thoughtful, making choices with care, understanding that our past actions, present experiences, and future circumstances originate in our minds.

Introspection is always retrospection.

sister smiles when one tells stories for she knows where the decoration has been added.
younger sister is someone to use as guinea pig in trying sledges and experimental go carts. Someone to send on messages to Mum. But someone who needs you who comes to you with bumped heads, grazed knees, tales of persecution. Someone who trusts you to defend her. Someone who thinks you know the answers to almost everything.
For there is no friend like sister, in calm or stormy weather, to cheer one on the tedious way, to fetch one if one goes astray, to lift one if one totters down, to strengthen whilst one stands.
How the hell do you sum up your sister in three minutes She's your twin and your polar opposite. She's your constant companion and your competition. She's your best friend and the biggest bitch in the world. She's everything you wish you could be and everything you wish you weren't.

They lived with you too long. And so, when you achieve some victory, friends are delighted but sisters hold your hands in silence and shine with happiness. For they know the cost.
Sisters don't need words. They have perfected language of snarls and smiles and frowns and winks expressions of shocked surprise and incredulity and disbelief. Sniffs and snorts and gasps and sighs that can undermine any tale you're telling.
sister is little bit of childhood that can never be lost.
sister is both your mirror and your opposite.
Sister is God's way of proving He doesn't want us to walk alone.

Sisters are splendid and incredible siblings who tower our life with exuberance and responsiveness at all times.
Sisters share the scent and smells the feel of common childhood.
Sisters touch your heart in ways no other could. Sisters share. their hopes, their fears, their love, everything they have. Real friendship springs from their special bonds.

Sweet is the voice of sister in the season of sorrow.
The mildest, drowsiest sister has been known to turn tiger if her sibling is in trouble.

We acquire friends and enemies, but our sisters come with the territory.
We are sisters. We will always be sisters. Our differences may never go away, but neither, for me, will our song.
What are sisters for if not to point out the things the rest of the world is too polite to mention.
When sisters stand shoulder to shoulder, who stands chance against us.
You can kid the world, but not your sister.
In the cookies of life, sisters are the chocolate chips.
Sister is probably the most competitive relationship within the family, but once the sisters are grown, it becomes the strongest relationship.
Sisters are different flowers from the same garden.
Sisters are for sharing laughter and wiping tears.

Every one is moon, and has dark side which he never shows to anybody.
The moon, like flower In heaven's high bower, With silent delight Sits and smiles on the night.
The moon can never breathe, but it can take our breath away with the beauty of its cold, arid orb.
The moon is beautiful only when the mind is seeking beauty and the heart is loving.
The wisdom of the Moon is greater than the wisdom of the Earth, because the Moonsees the universe better than the Earth can see it.

And he beholds the moon like rounded fragment of ice filled with motionless light.
If the moon smiled, she would resemble you. You leave the same impression Of something beautiful, but annihilating.

THIS MUST BE THURSDAY. NEVER COULD GET THE HANG OF THURSDAYS.
wish you tolerable Thursday. That's all any of us can hope for.
Thursday, forecast as mostly sunny. It's much needed break.
Thursday is perhaps the worst day of the week. It's nothing in itself it just reminds you that the week has been going on too long.
Thursdays are just wannabes. They wannabe Friday but they're not.
Thursday is end day in weekend. Today you are so tired and will think about how was your week and how will go on Thursday. With everything that has happened to you, you can either feel sorry for yourself, or treat what has happened as gift. Everythin.
Thursday. The most useless day. it only exists as reminder that it's been really long week. and it's still not over.
If 40 is the new 30 and 50 is the new 40, why can't Thursday be the new Friday.

All that really belongs to us is time even he who has nothing else has that.
No use thinking of the past for its gone, don't think of the future because it has to come, think of the present because thats where you are.
Yesterday's the past, tomorrow's the future, but today is gift. That's why it's called the present.
Time is what we want most, but. what we use worst.
Time is cruel thief to rob us of our former selves. We lose as much to life as we do to death.
If time flies when you're having fun, it hits the afterburners when you don't think you're having enough.
If we take care of the moments, the years will take care of themselves.
Time is the most valuable thing man can spend.
Time is the longest distance between two places.
Time is created thing. To say don't have time, is like saying, don't want to.
Know the true value of time snatch, seize, and enjoy every moment of it. No idleness, no laziness, no procrastination never put off till tomorrow what you can do today.
Time flies over us, but leaves its shadow behind.
The timeless in you is aware of life's timelessness. And knows that yesterday is but today's memory and tomorrow is today's dream.
The future is something which everyone reaches at the rate of sixty minutes an hour, whatever he does, whoever he is.
Suspect each moment, for it is thief, tiptoeing away with more than it brings.
The common man is not concerned about the passage of time, the man of talent is driven by it.
Old Time, that greatest and longest established spinner of all his factory is secret place, his work is noiseless, and his hands are mutes.
Time life therefore, waste your time and waste of your life, or master your time and master your life.
Don't be fooled by the calendar. There are only as many days in the year as you make use of. One man gets only week's value out of year while another man gets full year's value out of week.
We all have our time machines. Some take us back, they're called memories. Some take us forward, they're called dreams.
Time ripens all things with Time all things are revealed Time is the father of truth.
Men talk of killing time, while time quietly kills them.
For disappearing acts, it's hard to beat what happens to the eight hours supposedly left after eight of sleep and eight of work.
It's strange thing, but when you are dreading something, and would give anything to slow down time, it has disobliging habit of speeding up.
Time is like the wind, it lifts the light and leaves the heavy.
There is one kind of robber whom the law does not strike at, and who steals what is most precious to men time.
Time is the coin of your life. It is the only coin you have, and only you can determine how it will be spent. Be careful lest you let other people spend it for you.
Determine never to be idle. No person will have occasion to complain of the want of time who never loses any. It is wonderful how much can be done if we are always doing.
man who dares to waste one hour of life has not discovered the value of life.
Time is brisk wind, for each hour it brings something new. but who can understand and measure its sharp breath, its mystery and its design.
When as child laughed and wept, Time crept. When as youth waxed more bold. Time strolled. When became full grown man, Time RAN. When older still daily grew, Time FLEW. Soon shall find, in passing on, Time gone.
The world was made, not in time, but simultaneously with time. There was no time before the world.
Time goes, you say Ah no Alas, time stays, we go.
There is more time than life.
Time can bring you down, time can bend you knees. Times can break your heart, have you begging please Beyond the door, there peace sure. And know there ll be no more tears in heaven.
Time is neutral and does not change things. With courage and initiative, leaders change things.
If you let slip time, like neglected rose it withers on the stalk with languished head.
The moment hung in time like miner hat on an oaken peg in saloon abandoned ninety years ago.
The passing years are like mist sweeping up from the sea of time so that my memories acquire new aspects.
She was forever saving time, like bits of string.
There is rhythm inside year of time, like great mainspring that keeps it ticking from spring to summer to fall to winter.
Time substance of some sort which existence burned up like fire.
Time fled past us like startled bird.
If time seems to pass so quickly, this is because there are no landmarks. Like the moon when it is at its heights on the horizon.
As the waves make toward the pebbled shore, so do our minutes hasten to their end.
The day runs through me as water through sieve.
We must use time as tool, not as crutch.
Regret for wasted time is more wasted time.
Lost time is never found again.
The only reason for time is so that everything doesn't happen at once.
Time changes everything except something within us which is always surprised by change.
Those who make the worst use of their time are the first to complain of its brevity.
Time is an illusion.
Time takes it all, whether you want it to or not.
Better three hours too soon, than one minute too late.
Time is the wisest counselor of all.
Time is the school in which we learn, time is the fire in which we burn.
Nothing is waste of time if you use the experience wisely.
The key is in not spending time, but in investing it.
Time brings all things to pass.
You must have been warned against letting the golden hours slip by but some of them are golden only because we let them slip by.
Who forces time is pushed back by time who yields to time finds time on his side.
You can't make up for lost time. You can only do better in the future.
Yesterday is gone. Tomorrow has not yet come. We have only today. Let us begin.
must govern the clock, not be governed by it.
We must use time wisely and forever realize that the time is always ripe to do right.
