#### Win32TypingPracticeApp

  Vast majority of the code is in [BrightType1.1/BrightType1.1.cpp](https://github.com/brightgao1/Win32TypingPracticeApp/blob/main/BrightType1.1/BrightType1.1.cpp)

  I made this project to learn Win32, hence why I essentially implemented BS_AUTORADIOBUTTON instead of using it, as well as a trie for searching fonts. Ik some of the stuff I did was overkill, note that it was just for learning purposes.

  I programmed this in late 2024/early 2025. Unfortunately didn't have git installed at that time (nor a GH account). I do NOT add new features or work on this project anymore.

  In my app, you can go back to previous words while typing (accidental backspace at beginning of new word), and typing a space at the beginning of a new word will punish you, unlike popular typing sites like typeracer, monkeytype, etc... It's also much more efficient obviously, and runs smoothly on old computers.


  Feel free to take any of the code for use or fork the project, idc. Just know that I'm not responsible for anything if somehow (I doubt it tho) anything here gets used for commercial purposes.
