#### Win32TypingPracticeApp

I programmed this in late 2024/early 2025. Unfortunately didn't have git installed at that time tho. I do NOT add new features or work on this project anymore.

In my app, you can go back to previous words while typing (accidental backspace at beginning of new word), and typing a space at the beginning of a new word will punish you, unlike popular typing sites like typeracer, monkeytype, etc... It's also much more efficient obviously, and runs smoothly on old computers.


Feel free to take any of the code for use or fork the project, idc. Just know that I'm not responsible for anything if somehow (I doubt it tho) anything here gets used for commercial purposes.
